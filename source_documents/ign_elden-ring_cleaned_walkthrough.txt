location, boss strategy and more. continuing in the vein of previous titles from fromsoftware including dark souls and bloodborne, elden ring is set in a brand new world of dark fantasy, and brimming with dangerous dungeons and powerful enemies. long ago, the land was ruled by an eternal queen marika and her demigod children, under the blessing of the giant erdtree and the magical power known as the elden ring. however, unknown forces stole the rune of death from the elden ring's power, bringing about war and cataclysm between the demigods, and the elden ring was shattered. your task as one of the formerly exiled tarnished is to return to the lands between ruined by war, and recover the great runes from the maddened demigods to become an elden lord. unlike previous from software titles, elden ring allows you to traverse a vast open world filled with lost souls, treasure, various challenging mini dungeons , imposing roaming world bosses , and secrets in every corner. each major region of the lands between is home to a legacy dungeon, home to one of the demigods, and more familiar to souls fans as a more traditional and possibly linear dungeon experience. because of this, you'll be able to approach your adventure in a variety of ways, and possibly even tackle the different legacy dungeons in different orders. get started with essential tips and tricks and things elden ring doesn't tell you , and then use our walkthrough and guide to help you through each of the main legacy dungeons for strategies on advancing through the tricky locations, tips to defeat the bosses within - as well as where to find every item , weapon , armor , and more along the way. if you just want to read up on a boss, we also assembled a complete list of elden ring bosses along with tips and videos on how to beat them. ign's elden ring walkthrough is presented with the initial tutorial intro, followed by general overviews for each segment of the main regions of the lands between, with links to all major points of interest, mini dungeons, roaming bosses, and secrets. once you've had your fill exploring and getting more powerful, our walkthrough continues with in depth guides for the legacy dungeon of that region, including how to get in, and how to defeat the bosses within while finding every item and secret path along the way. to learn more, select a section below: stranded

how to get every ending unlike other open world rpgs and action games, elden ring's side quests are exclusively tied to the characters you meet as your travel through the lands between. many of them can be found in secret locations, and may travel to different regions as you do over the course of the game, pursing their own agendas. some will help you, others may lie or even turn against you - and certain character quests can culminate in helping you achieve different endings by allying yourself to certain people or factions - and only by following their questline can you activate these endings after beating the final boss. note that you won't have to choose between character quests to follow whether or not you choose to invoke an ending they may have for you. all character questlines can be completed alongside each other (or ended early if you decide to kill someone). below you'll find the most major questlines that can trigger unique endings: ranni the witch's

questline for all other questlines for minor character - including where to find them and what rewards they give, see our complete npc character side quest guide./n the stranded graveyard - also known as the cave of knowledge - is the opening tutorial area for elden ring. it is where each player will begin their journey regardless of the class you choose. it is also completely optional, as the tutorial itself can be found by jumping down a large pit - or bypassed by walking around the pit and up the stairs to an elevator leading to the region of limgrave. the choice is yours on which path to take, but it’s best for new players to check out the cave, while experienced souls players can opt to skip the tutorial as not much is gained other than a few items, an emote, and currency. after creating your chosen tarnished, choosing their physique, class, and starting keepsake, you'll awaken in the chapel of anticipation. the lonely and forgotten place is devoid of enemies, but you can find a dead maiden near the door that holds a tarnished's wizened finger . with this item, you can create messages in the ground that can be seen by other players. exit through the main door, and you'll an enormous glowing tree far in the distance, with a large castle shilouetted in storms across a large gap. head towards the balcony looking off the castle, and you can find wooden scaffolding heading down to the left. from here, you can cross a long rope bridge leading further across the high peaks of the island, leading to a large statue of marika - and a boss fight. if you weren't sure - the grafted scion is one of those extremely tough enemies that from software likes to throw at new players right off the bat so they can die. painfully. you don't even have to worry about beating this boss, and you don't even have any way to heal as you are, so enjoy you first taste of elden ring. once you've been defeated, your body will presumably fall to the ocean below, where the tides will take you somewhere new - and a mysterious girl on a horse will find you. you'll awaken in the stranded graveyard, and to the right you'll find a large cave that serves as a tutorial of sorts. it's a good way to get your bearings, learn the controls, and see some new features that elden ring has in store for you. dropping down into the cave below, you’ll get a primer on how to use items - remember that in addition to the items you can cycle through on your d-pad, you can also assign items to a quick slot. just ahead is the cave of knowledge site of grace, which serves as a bonfire of sorts in elden ring. resting at these refills your health and fp flasks, resurrects most defeated enemies, and allows you to assign magic spells, and search your storage. new to elden ring - you can also change the time of day and equip new weapon skills and scaling properties by collecting ashes of war. not far past the site of grace are some fairly docile enemies you can test out either magic or melee, as well as locking on and strafing around targets. after killing them, the path will lead upwards, and you’ll be able to jump at will to climb the steps to a larger cavern. an enemy above may try to take potshots at you, and you can either fire back with magic or move ahead to get out of range for now. past the large cavern is another shielded enemy that may signal a good time to try switching up tactics, including swapping weapons, and shifting into a two-handed stance. this can be done by pressing triangle/y and either r1 or l1. using weapons in a two-handed stances can give you a lot more offensive power, bashing through hardened defenses, and sometimes it can even pierce the hide of tough enemies that may cause one-handed weapons to bounce off! wielding a weapon in two hands is also the best way to enact weapon skills - each weapon comes with a default skill that can enhance your abilities in exchange for fp, and these can often be customized for each weapon as you find ashes of war. after clearing out a few more undead, you’ll move across the bridge where the soldier from earlier was hounding you, and the path will lead to a large cave filled with foliage. this is a good place to test out the new stealth mechanic. though the act itself isn’t too complex, it allows you to crouch down and make less noise to sneak up on enemies, or move unseen through dense underbrush or plants, allowing you to choose when to unleash a sneak attack from behind for extra damage, or escape undetected. further up, you’ll get the chance to try out charging up attacks either on the ground or when jumping to put additional force behind your attack - which can be perfect for breaking the stance of an enemy, and allowing you to follow up close with a critical strike. in the room beyond, you’ll find a stake of marika. these serve as pseudo respawn points in place of a site of grace. this means upon death, you can choose to return to the last site of grace you died at, or a stakes of marika that may be much closer to where you died. however, the stakes can’t be rested at nor can you use any of the features the sites of grace have, so you’ll have to choose wisely. this boss is less of an actual boss, and more of a way for you to experiment with everything you’ve learned in the cave of knowledge. don’t be fooled by the exaggerated health bar, the soldier of godrick has very low health, and while more aggressive than most enemies you’ve seen, won’t last very long. consider utilizing the guard counter move here - as it allows you to perform a quick and decisive counter-attack when you press rt right after blocking an incoming attack. this is not to be confused with the shield’s parry weapon skill, as the parry must be timed right as an attack is going to land to deflect the blow and leave the enemy open for a critical strike. the guard counter requires you to hold block down until after the attack lands before striking back with a strong blow - but it will require a short wind-up and long swing, so it’s best used when you know the enemy isn’t launching a series of hits, and it’s not as effective against crowds. using these attacks, the soldier of godrick will likely go down in just a few hits, just be sure to block or dodge roll around his sweeping sword swings, and lay on the damage until he’s either dead or gets his stance broken and can be critically hit to finish him off. defeating this tutorial boss won’t net you much other than a few hundred runes - the currency of elden ring used to level up and buy supplies - but more on that later. for now, you can exit the room that will deposit you back where you started above the cave of knowledge, and up on the ledge you'll find your true reward - the strength emote . from here you can drop down and head through the doorway up the stairs to find the stranded graveyard site of grace. you may also notice a body dangling off a high ledge at the back of the cave where you started - you can't reach him from here, but as you explore the world outside, you may find an alternate cave that leads you back to the body! next to the site of grace, you'll find a mysterious forcefield next to a statue of two imps on top of each other. you can unlock the forcefield by finding rare stonesword keys, and embedding them in the imp statues. sometimes you'll only need one key - sometimes more, and there are many such statue doors all over the lands between, so you'll need to choose wisely what you want to use your keys on. from the site of grace, head straight and take the elevator to leave this tutorial behind and enter the first region in the lands between - limgrave. what you do from here is largely up to you: there’s already a vast open world to explore, and you can run straight to the nearest legacy dungeon by following the strands of light from the sites of grace that point like arrows to the east and then north towards stormveil castle. however, there’s plenty to see and do before then, and you may want to do a bit of exploring before venturing into the perilous place. you can start by reading up on things to do first in elden ring - including how to level up and get your mount , as well as getting some vital supplies from the merchant who lives not far away at the church of elleh (and maybe steer clear of that imposing mounted knight nearby). you can also check out a host of mini dungeons that dot the landscape in limgrave, as they often hide valuable items and treasure. after that, you can view our overview guide of west limgrave , east limgrave , and the weeping peninsula to the south - or you can dare to venture north towards the foreboding stormveil castle, the first legacy dungeon . /n west limgrave is one of the main regions of the lands between in elden ring. this page includes an overview of the area, including all main dungeons, bosses, loot, and secrets to find in this region. west limgrave is the starting region you will begin your journey as a tarnished in, from the tutorial dungeon known as the cave of knowledge , to meeting the finger maiden melina, and the first legacy dungeon - stormveil castle . as a starting region, it includes many basic types of foes to help you learn the ropes of this world, but also holds many secrets and surprisingly tough boss fights that roam the region, letting you cut your teeth against powerful foes once you get a few levels and access to better gear. main roads criss-cross the land, one of which leads across the bridge of sacrifice towards the weeping peninsula , while another road leads out of storm hill across the saintsbridge to east limgrave , whererin lies the mistwood. in order to reveal the details and topography of the full limgrave region, you'll need to find three map fragments at the steles located in west limgrave, east limgrave, and the weeping peninsula. the west limgrave map fragment is located at a stele found in the gatefront ruins, which you can find after exiting the tutorial dungeon by following the main road past the church of elleh through a small forest and into a large enemy camp at the foot of the stormgate. limgrave's legacy dungeon is called stormveil castle , and it is the first such main dungeon you will encounter naturally in elden ring. it is an incredibly large fortress that looms over the rest of the region from its fortified clifftop position on the north side of limgrave. it is ruled over by one of the demigods, godrick the golden. to enter the dungeon, you'll either have to brave the stormgate and its veritable defenses, and defeat a very imposing boss just to enter the castle proper. it is highly recommended that you withhold your adventure there until you explore more of the region, level up, find new items and rewards, and enhance your armament using smithing stones at the church of elleh's smithing table. when you are ready, view our stormveil castle walkthrough to learn how to defeat its many enemies and find every secret within. stormveil castle bosses npcs magrit the fell omen gatekeeper gostoc rogier , nepheli loux godrick the golden west limgrave is home to several world bosses that

recipe books, and a torch to help you traverse darkened caves. the church is also home to a smithing table that holds a smithing stone shard . by interacting with this table, you can upgrade your weapons using smithing stone shards you find, up to a maximum of +3. enemies: soldiers of godrick (8), attack dogs (4), godrick knight (1) this large ruined encampment is crawling with soldiers, many of which are lurking among the crumbling walls and the two large carriages at either end of the camp. a sentry patrols the main road through the ruins along with a much stronger knight, and if spotted, the sentry will use their trumpet to summon all nearby enemies to converge on their position. it's best to tackle the encampment from the northern side by the nearby site of grace, picking off the soldiers on the outskirts away from the sentry, and looting the back of the first large carriage to get the lordsworn's greatsword . from here you can wait until the sentry is alone and sneak up to backstab them - and which point you can either avoid or lure the armored knight with the spear into lone combat. they're both guarding a large stone stelle monument in the center that holds the west limgrave map that can expand your map topography. be wary when engaging the godrick knight, he's much tougher than the surrounding soldiers, and will hit faster and harder - but can still be parried to open up for critical hits, or you can wait for the end of his barrage of thrusts or charge to perform a guard counter. once you've cleared the middle, make your way along the western part of the ruins to take out more soldiers and their attack dogs. moving along south are more guards with attack dogs, look among the ruins near the central road on the west side to find a hole you can walk down leading to a room with a chest that holds the ash of war - storm stomp, as well as a whetstone so that you can customize your ashes of war each time you rest at a site of grace, instead of having to find a smith to do it for you. back in the ruins, you can clear out the east side of the camp and look for those guarding the second carriage on the south side and loot the back to find a flail . enemies: kaiden mercenaries (4), attack dogs (4) this small camp can be found due west from the gatefront ruins, where a line of wooden barricades have been set up between two large stone ruins. the camp is patrolled by a kaiden mercenary on horseback, while three others wait on the other side of the wooden walls, as well as several dogs that roam the area and the ruins it borders. due to the aggressive nature of the mercenaries, it's best to try to lure them out one at a time, so you aren't overwhelmed by their strong melee attacks - though you can also use the ruins to get some height over them. once the guards are defeated, search the small camp for a body that holds the armorer's cookbook 1 enemies: land octopus, skeletons, demi-humans, northern mercenary npcs: nomadic merchant this area is found along the northwestern area of limgrave, with beach access located along the cliffs north of the cave of knoweldge tutorial dungeon (though a troll wanders the path down to the beach). on the far north side of the beach, you can find a solitary kaiden mercenary who holds a strip of white flesh , and just to the south is a mysterious glowing trail passing among the rocks. if you attack as the trail comes to you, you'll kill an invisible scarab beetle and gain the ash of war - stamp (sweep) . further south past several imposing land octopus you may find a group of demi-humans outside the entrance to a small mini dungeon, the coastal cave - that also serves as a tunnel to the nearby island and home of the church of dragon communion. nearby is a large slab of a fallen stone ruin that forms a shelter from the elements, and inside you can find a nomadic merchant who sells a few starting weapons. on the far south side of the beach you'll find a group of skeletons that will attempt to swarm you, and keep coming back when killed unless you strike at their bodies while they glow and begin to reform - otherwise they'll keep coming back. nearby spiritsprings will let you jump all the way back up to the stranded graveyard. enemies: miranda plants, giant miranda plant, mad pumpkin head (mini boss) npcs: sorceress sellen the post town remains is a hillside ruin off the large main road running through limgrave, past the large bridge and up on the hills overlooking the road on the west edge of the region. the ruins themselves are crawling with small moving miranda plants that emit spores to poison you when you draw near, and must be killed quickly or at range. to make matters harder, they are overseen by a giant miranda plant that can summon magical projectiles from the sky in addition to releasing a greater poison cloud, and must be attacked carefully to avoid their moves. a group of smaller ones are huddled in the ruins on the south side guarding some glowstone , while the larger one in the middle guards bodies that hold immunizing cured meat and a golden rune . above the giant miranda plant, you can spot a body dangling off some ruins that you can use torrent to jump to and find trina's lily x4. in the middle of the ruins is the entrance to an underground tunnel - but you can bypass it by dropping down from the ruined slabs above, or using torrent to double jump over the walls. inside is a single mini-boss, a mad pumpkin head. though there is no dungeon attached to this area, mad pumpkin head is still a formidable opponent. he uses a spiked flail in a near never-ending stream of aggressive attacks that are hard to get away from. pumpkin head's weapon will constantly inflict bleed on you - even if blocked, and to make matters worse, he will try to slam his armored head down on you, which will greatly dampen any attacks that hit his head. you may want to rely more on dodging than blocking - or try to judge his attacks to parry the swings from the flail, and get around to attack on his side or back where his helmet won't block the blows. you can also try summoning a spirit with a lot of health to try diverting his attention, letting you attack from behind. always leave some stamina left to quickly dodge around his follow up flail swings or punches, and be ready to let out a few attacks of your own until he starts up again. once the mad pumpkin head is defeated, he won't drop any loot sadly, but you will have access to a back room where sorceress sellen resides, and she can teach you several glintstone sorceries, as well as the nod in thought emote. for a price, she can teach you various spells, and you can return to give her sorcery scrolls you find to increase her array of items. enemies: troll (2), kaiden mercenary, noble sorcerer, wandering nobles this roving point of interest will always begin on the road south of waypoint ruins, and slowly make its way up to the gatefront ruins by the end of the day. the caravan is pulled along by two trolls staked with large chains attached to the carriage, and in its wake is a large group of enemies - but are thankfully spread out enough that you can pick them off in smaller groups. you can get the attention of the mounted kaiden mercenary first and knock him off his horse to kill him quickly, and then look for the ghoul with a cape to defeat the noble sorcerer so you don't have to worry about random spells coming your way. after that, you can easily mop up the wandering nobles following the carriage as they move and attack slowly. you won't be able to loot the caravan until it stops, which means either following it all the way to the gatefront ruins, or attacking the trolls that lead it. luckily they are tethered to the carriage, and so you can perform hit and run attacks, and all they can do in return is stomp in place angrily. once both are defeated, you can loot the back of the carriage to earn the greataxe . enemies: troll, foot soldiers, godrick soldiers, wolves (above), kaiden mercenary (gatehouse) the imposing stormgate stands at the foot of the gatefront ruins near the northeast side of limgrave's main road. it is the main path up for those wishing to attack stormveil castle, and as such is heavily guarded. to make matters worse, a large troll warrior waits on a large ruin that covers part of the canyon, and will jump down to meet you as four soldiers of godrick open fire with crossbows. because of this, there are two preffered strategies to deal with this area: lure the troll out of the gate and away from the crossbowmen, or head east to find a spiritspring jump point to get around the chokepoint and face the troll on the top (though there are wolves on both sides of the gorge that may rush in to make things harder). getting the troll by himself will make things easier, whether you want to try hit and run attack on horseback, or get up close and personal, and dodge his large sweeps and stomps. he has a few quick backhands when turning, and once at half health, will take out his sword to slam down - and anything less than a perfectly timed dodge will send you flying. be ready to dodge his downsward slams and stabs, as well as his loping sweep attack that needs a lot of dodging, and take your time learning the troll's movement patterns to attack safely. once the troll is finished off, you can return to the chokepoint to rush the crossbowmen and the two foot soldiers assisting them, and clear them out before looting the bodies nearby to grab a lump of flesh and golden rune . further up the path as it leads out is a lone soldier of godrick - but don't be fooled. he has a horn, and will sound it to summon several soldiers hiding in the bushes nearby to overwhelm you. defeat him and his minions, and exit the gorge to find a golden seed growing along the road. if you double back along the ridge overlooking the gorge, you can check where the troll was standing to find a body with a golden rune 2 . further up on the west side you can find an entrance to the gatehouse ramparts where a teardrop scarab is hiding along a rock wall. a kaiden mercenary patrols the entrance, and further inside are two more soldier of godrick that guard a chest - and it contains an arrow's reach talisman . enemies: wandering nobles, giant rats, mongrels the large water-logged ruins can be found in the middle of the southern side of the large lake agheel, not far to the south from where the great dragon agheel himself will land at a large bonfire, and just to the southwest of several poison barnacles guarding a tomb with some arteria leaf . the ruins are crawling with wandering nobles - but most of them will flee from you, save for those carrying torches, as they will try to slowly push you away with the flames. if you carefully check among the ruins to the south, you can hop over the crumbing walls to find a tunnel holding a chest with a twinblade . several mongerls also patrol the narrow flooded ruins and can ambush you from the sides. the middle of the ruins holds a large crumbling tower with an open side where a giant rat is hiding alongside a stonesword key . on the other side of the crumbling tower among a large group of wandering nobles is a hole in the stones you can find a passage below ground leading to a large chamber and a chest - but beware! opening this chest will trigger a teleportation trap to take you to an extremely dangerous dungeon with no easy way out ! enemies: spirit jellyfish (nighttime only) this strange isolated island off the west coast of limgrave cannot be traveled to by regular means, as the deep waters will kill you. instead, you must travel through the nearby dissenter's cave along the coastline that connects to the island. the island is home to a large ruin with the remains of a large dragon, though you won't find many creatures around save for some wildlife - as well as wandering spirit jellyfish at night. once you have defeated any dragon - like the great dragon agheel in the middle of west limgrave's lake, you can take the dragon heart gained from defeating them to offer at this church, in exchange for one of three dragon-inspired spells. each of them requires a fair amount of faith and arcane to wield, but they will all invoke a terrible dragon power, and can be quite deadly. dragon communion powers dragonfire incantation (1 dragon heart) dragonclaw incantation (1 dragon heart) dragonmaw incantation (1 dragon heart) exploring around the island yields little, other than a body on the southwest has great dragonfly head x4, and a lower platform on the south side is hiding a scarab beetle that can give you a somber smithing stone 1 if you run it down, and further down the ledge is another body holding smithing stone 2 . traveling southeast along the cliffs from the stranded graveyard will lead you along some ruins overlooking the beach below - as well as a body near a hole holding a smithing stone 1 (that you should not jump in. you can however get down to the beach itself - either through clever jumping on torrent down to a lower ledge north of the site of grace, which leads down to a large platform with an alpha wolf guarding some flowers - or by traveling south and jumping down to where you see the spiritspring jump point along the beach - as landing inside it will cushion your fall. besides a giant crab wandering the north end of the beach, you'll also run into a lone alabaster lord here. he is suprisingly tough, and may give you a run for your money - due to his ability to use gravity-based magic to pull you in. he'll either raise one hand to try and hit you with a gravitational projectile, or slam his sword in and perform a giant pulling shockwave. either of these moves will usually see him follow up with long chain attacks, or a frontal stab to skewer you on his long sword. be sure to dodge around behind him - even if you do get pulled in, and watch for when his long swings end, but don't be fooled if he stabs forward into the ground with his sword, as he'll pull it back to deal damage close to him. fight cautiously, and he'll go down and give you the ash of war - gravitas to let you make shockwaves of your own with your chosen weapon. before taking the spiritspring out of the beach, you can also look north along the cliffs for a secret entrance back into the cave of knowledge putting you out on a ledge to find a haligdrake talisman . south of the large lage in west limgrave is a site of grace, overlooking a large fight between soldiers and demi-humans to the west, and a small dip in the lake where many giant crabs surround a scarab holding the ash of war - unsheathe . to the south are two separate hills with a road between them leading off to the weeping peninsula. the southwest hill holds an evergaol mini boss to cut your teeth on, while the southeast hill has been turned into an encampment. you can also explore on the other side of the southeast hill to find many demi-humans, some of them will be guarding a large club . the path leading up to the encampment has a few noble undead and kaiden mercenaries patrolling it - and some of the undead have horns to summon the soldiers further up the hill. the real trouble comes once you get close enough to the barricades to engage the mercs and soldiers, as two noble sorcerers sit on two large ruins and will cast magic from their vantage point at you, which can be a pain to constantly dodge as you fight your way up. you may want to blaze up the side on torrent to quickly crest the hill and ambush them before the soldiers can come after you. once the sorcerers are taken care of loot a body on the east side to find a royal house scroll . most of the other noble undead here will flee, allowing you to focus on the soldiers of godrick at the top of the hill. try not to get overwhelmed, and let them chase you to split them up if needed. once the group is cleared, search the main camp around the tents to find a chest that holds a great epee , and then search along the ridge of the hill along the top for a monument with starlight shards . further north of the stormgate above storm hill are two shacks that house friendly npcs. first along the road you can find the storm hill shack where roderika resides, afraid of what lurks in stormveil castle. keeep talking to her and you'll get the sitting sideways emote , and eventually the spirit jellyfish ashes . there's also a corpse on a platform outside the shack holding a stonesword key . another path will take you east, away from the castle, but be sure to look for a large plateau to the north where a lone troll warrior patrols. he's guarding a small basin along the ridge, and it holds a strength-knot crystal tear that you'll be able to use with the flask of wondrous physick located in east limgrave. further along the eastern path, watch for patrolling kaiden mercenaries and noble sorcerers hiding in the bushes, before you reach a crossroads where the warmaster's shack is. here, knight bernahl the warmaster will sell you ashes of war, to let you customize your weapons with different skills. be warned - once you've delved into stormveil castle, returning to the shack at night you may find him absent, but a very deadly invader in his place! the edge of west limgrave area is bordered by the large saintsbridge, but there's many other areas surrounding it. making your way east from the warmaster's shack, you'll come upon a large encampment of soldiers - with some on both sides holding horns to signal an alarm. you can ambush them by sneaking in the sides, or even jumping from the ridge above to a large ruin where a body holds a lance . while a few foot soldiers guard the entrances, more are found inside with several attack dogs that flank a godrick knight armed with a longsword. he can be incredibly powerful with his weapon arts, so utilize spirit summons if you can to distract him and keep him off-balance. once the camp is clear, be sure to search the bodies nearby for exalted flesh , and a chest by the foot of the ruins for a beast crest heater shield . up on the ridge to the north of the camp is a lone godrick knight on horseback. he can be a very tough encounter armed with his spear and ability to charge his attacks with holy might. try to use a long reaching weapon of your own to out-joust him, and aim for his horse to unseat him, as he'll struggle to rise and give you the chance to critical strike him on the ground. defeating him will earn his ash of war - golden vow , and you can look on the square ruins nearby for a scarab to chase down holding a somber smithing stone 1 . just to the south of the saintsbridge, you can hear the voice of a man in need of help. as it happens, it's not a man, but a living jar named alexander the iron fist. he's friendly, and in return for helping him out, he'll give you some exalted flesh , and tell you about a festival in caelid. finally, to the north of the sainstbridge is the entrance to the death-touched catacombs , and further north along the underside of the great bridge you'll find another damaged golem that will spring to life. it won't drop anything, but it is guarding a body nearby that holds a lance talisman . as you explore this region, you may come across several scarabs scampering away. some of them will refill your flask of tears, but others can reward you with special items: reward: ash of war - determination you can find this scarab sitting the main road that runs south of the gatefront ruins towards the large bridge that crosses the ravine near agheel lake. a few soldiers are camped nearby, so don't let them surprise you when running for the scarab. reward: ash of war - unsheathe this scarab is located in a small pool of water at the southern tip of the large lake in limgrave, though it is surrounded by a giant crab and many other smaller crabs. be wary if you get close - the giant crab can cover a lot of distance quickly, and another giant crab will emerge from underwater close by. reward: ash of war - stamp (sweep) this scarab can be tough to spot - as it's primarily invisible. you can only spot its movement by the light trail it leaves in its wake, as it weaves between tall rocky pillars at the top northwest edge of the waterfront, northwest of the church of elleh. instead of trying to chase the trail on horseback, simply wait for it to come to you by watching the trail for a bit, and swing or cast an area of effect spell when it gets close. reward: somber smithing stone 1 to get this scarab, you'll need to reach the small island off the coast of limgrave by way of the coastal cave dungeon. once you arrive, head through the ruined church to the back and look off to the left to find a series of lower platforms on the edge of the island, and the scarab will be among them. reward: ash of war - wild strikes this scarab is located in plain view on the main road leading north from the stormgate up past the stormhill shack, and right before the series of barricades leading to the main gate of stormveil castle and its first boss fight. however, it's also in range of a ballista aimed in your direction, so move fast or you'll risk getting hit. reward: somber smithing stone you can spot this scarab by heading north then east from the warmaster's shack - east of stormveil castle. just below the large bridge leading towards the divine tower of limgrave is a large chunk of ruin patrolled by a godrick knight, and jumping to the top of the square ruin you can find a scarab perched on top. as expected, there are a plethora of secrets for you to uncover across the region in elden ring ranging from veiled imp statue doors to teleporters, chest traps, and mimics. here you’ll find all of the secrets found so far in the west limgrave area. not long after starting the game, you’ll encounter an imp statue seal at the stranded graveyard. if you started the game with a stonesword key, you can choose to use them here and unlock the fringefolk hero’s grave . however, even if you do unlock it now, it’s best to visit this later on when you’ve leveled up as the boss battle against the ulcerated tree spirit is a tough one. if you didn't start with a stonesword key , you're in luck as you'll be able to pick up some as soon as you enter the west limgrave area. you can find them in the following areas: at the dragon-burnt ruins on the corpse at stormhill shack looking for stonesword keys ? head to our stonesword key locations page. near agheel lake south, you'll see a number of noble undead working on the rocks. there is one particular undead, that when defeated, will turn into a powerful runebear. defeat it, and it will drop a larval tear - an item you can use later in the game to respec your attributes. /n east limgrave is the smallest sub-region of limgrave in elden ring. this page includes an overview of the area, including all main dungeons, bosses, loot, and secrets to find in this region. located east of stormveil castle and west of the scarlet rot-ridden caelid , east limgrave is easily accessible from either fork roads heading to saintsbridtige or the weeping peninsula (south limgrave) . as a sub-region, east limgrave does not contain a legacy dungeon. there are also no small dungeons in the region. you can access the siofra river underground area from the siofra river well directly next to the minor erdtree of east limgrave. to reveal the details and topography of the whole limgrave region, you'll need to find three map fragments at the steles located in west limgrave, east limgrave, and the weeping peninsula. the east limgrave map fragment is located in mistwood, near the minor erdtree. keep moving south of the main road from the third church of marika—the stele will be close to a giant bear scratching a tree. being such a small part of limgrave, there is only one boss available in the entirety of east limgrave—the tibia mariner in summonwater village . boss name reward 1 tibia mariner deathroot , skeleton militia spirit ashes as you explore the region of limgrave, you'll find various friendly (or seemingly friendly) faces you can find and speak to - and even buy and sell with to obtain unique wares. nomadic merchant - there are two locations in east limgrave where you can find the nomadic merchant; one is east of saintsbridge, and another is south of the minor erdtree. nomadic merchant's wares

summonwater village. he'll warn you that the village is now overrun with undead and mark your map with a red "x." defeating the field boss here will continue his quest as he moves permanently to the roundtable hold . kenneth haight - kenneth haight is a self-proclaimed next ruler of limgrave. you can find him atop curved ruins that serve as a bridge, east of the mistwood outskirts site of grace. he'll ask you to clear out fort haight and defeat the knight commander residing in there. blaidd - a long figure perches atop the mistwood ruins howling from time to time. if you talk to merchant kale about it, he'll give you a way to summon the strange half-wolf, half-man named blaidd, who seems to be trying to hunt down a particular foe you may already have encountered at the forlorn hound evergaol - so be sure to head back there to continue his story. he'll award you a somber smithing stone for taking down bloodhound knight darriwil in the gaol, and this won't be the last you see of the half-wolf. alexander, the iron fist - if you helped the living jar out of his predicament in west limgrave, you can find him again in east limgrave, in the secret rear entrance to gael tunnel. he's lost his way on the journey to caelid, and neither of you will be able to progress past the site of grace. if you enter caelid and go into the mini dungeon, you can open the door to help him on his way (though he'll find his way to the tournament regardless). though east limgrave is small, this sub-region contains many points of interests that can move you to other locations in the lands between. this area is also great to gather bolstering materials and additional equipment to better equip yourself for your journey beyond limgrave. click on a point of interest to jump to the sections

limgrave, summonwater village, is the only place in the region where you'll find a boss—the tibia mariner . you'll naturally come across this ruined village if you go east of the main road from saintsbridge. here you'll also find d, hunter of dead , who warns you of the boss. the tibia mariner fight is relatively easy as long as you use torrent. just keep up with him when he teleports, and you should be able to down him quickly. bring the deathroot you obtain from the boss to d in the roundtable hold to access the bestial sanctum in caelid. be sure to explore the village for additional loot as well. you can unlock an underground cellar using a stonesword key that holds a green turtle talisman . directly south of the summonwater village is a waterfall where a pack of wolves resides. you can find them fighting a runebear here. it's best to dodge them and loot up the smithing stone 2 from the nearby corpse. a recurring point of interest in elden ring, the artist's shack is an abandoned shack that houses different paintings. this one, in particular, contains the "homing instinct" painting, solvable at the seaside ruins near the starting area in west limgrave. check out the painting locations and solutions portion of our wiki for more info on how to solve each painting. the third church of marika is located south of the summonwater falls, on the main road alongside mistwood. not only can you pick up a sacred tear just like other churches of marika, but you'll also be able to grab the flask of wondrous physick with a crimson crystal tear here as well. there is a troll roaming the church that you can avoid as long as you don't use the main road. be sure to head north of the church, up some rocks to kill a scarab containing an ash of war - sacred blade . this site of grace can be found just before the third church of marika, right alongside the main road. here you'll also find kenneth haight atop the curved ruin that serves as a bridge. underneath the bridge, there are demi-humans and wandering nobles roaming the area. there is a fervor's cookbook 1 you can loot here as well. this point of interest can be challenging for low-level players because it's a hotspot for runebears. there are quite a few items you can pick up here, from the nomadic warrior cookbook 4 to the map fragment for east limgrave—the latter is located alongside the main road near a runebear scratching a tree. just southwest of the map stelle, you'll soon find the mistwood ruins hidden among the trees and vegetation. a ghost npc will lead you to these ruins if you examine the spectral candelabra near the watering hole. this ghost npc often disappears but will leave glowing footsteps that you can follow. directly following his tracks can lead you too close to the runebear that's scratching the tree, so we recommend following him from the opposite side of the main road until you pass the runebear. there is another runebear sleeping inside the ruins, blocking the entrance to the underground cellar. while you can use your summoning ashes to fight them, you can roll down to the basement after attacking them—the runebear won't be able to follow you down there. go ahead and loot the axe talisman and make your way out safely. in addition, the mistwood ruins are the starting point for blaidd questline . you may hear a distinct howling as you explore the ruins - and it's coming from a character perched on top of the ruins above you. in order to get him down, you may want to check in with merchant kale back in west limgrave's church of elleh - he may know just the thing. on the southwesternmost tip of east limgrave, you'll find the stone cemetery. there aren't many enemies here outside of your average skeletons and miranda flowers. you can loot a sacrificial twig from one of the corpses lying on top of one of the stone caskets. one of the two minor erdtrees in limgrave, you can find this erdtree right next to the siofra river well, just to the left of the area's map stelle. this one, however, does not host an erdtree avatar boss—so you can safely loot both the spiked cracked tear and the greenspill crystal tear . be sure to find the white scarab somewhere near the tree, as it contains an ash of war - ground slam . this fort is the one kenneth haight mentioned when you first met him. as part of his quest, you'll have to clear out every enemy inside fort haight, so expect a variety of different mobs here—from your run-of-the-mill soldiers of godrick and commoners to a godrick knight and a pumpkin head. make your way to the top of the fort and loot the chest to obtain the dectus medallion (left) , one-half of an essential item you'll need later on in your journey. once you clear out the overrun fort, return to kenneth in mistwood outskirts to obtain your reward, and erdsteel dagger . you can fast travel back to fort haight to talk to him once more, where he promises to hold a festival in your name... though that may never come to pass. as you explore this region, you may come across several scarabs scampering away. some of them will refill your flask of tears, but others can reward you with special items: reward: somber smithing stone 1 looking to the west of the artist shack on the border of east and west limgrave, journey along the cliffs above the murkwater canyon and you can spot a scarab along the cliff edge. be warned - the scarab will explode when killed! reward: ash of war - sacred blade when at the third church of marika near the east central side of east limgrave, leave and cross the shallow river to find a winding path up the cliffs, and you can spot this scarab along this path behind the church ruins. reward: ash of war - ground slam exploring the large minor erdtree in east limgrave, you'll find many red teardrop scarabs that can replenish your flask. however, explore the woods to the south of the tree and you can also spot another silver scarab that holds an ash of war. while smaller in scope than west limgrave, there are still a few secrets for you to uncover across the region, including sending gate teleporters, and access to new areas. just up the road from the map stele in mistwood is a small domed building. this hides an elevator that will take you far, far underground to an entirely new region - the siofra river. it's a bit more dangerous than limgrave, and you should probably grab the site of grace below and plan to come back after clearing stormveil castle . should you wish to press on and explore this mysterious underground ruin, see our siofra river walkthrough for more details. if you helped out d, hunter of the dead near the entrance to this region, you may already know about this, but there's a secret portal in east limgrave. it's hiding at the end of the river falls that runs past the third church of marika, and can be hard to spot hidden among the shrubs. taking this teleporter will send you far to the east in the most dangerous part of caelid - greyoll's dragonbarrow. thankfully the sanctum is (mostly) safe, where a strange beastman cleric named garranq will teach you bestial incantations in exchange for the deathroot found from those who live in death, like the tibia mariner world boss. just be careful if you choose to step outside the sanctum... you won't see this change in terrain your first time through east limgrave, but later in the game, the death of one of the demigods will trigger a meteor to come crashing down to earth. if you return to east limgrave near fort haight, you'll find an incredibly large crater in the area that used to be south of mistwood ruins. this giant hole opens up a new area of the siofra river well to explore - a place known as nokron, eternal city , and is essential to a certain character's questline. /n weeping peninsula (south limgrave) is a smaller region of limgrave in elden ring. this page includes an overview of the area, including all main dungeons, bosses, loot, and secrets to find in this region. weeping peninsula is the region directly south of west limgrave. you'll first access this region by crossing the bridge of sacrifice , a bridge camp filled with soldiers of godrick. as a sub-region, weeping peninsula does not contain a legacy dungeon. however, there are many small dungeons, side quests, and roaming bosses to tackle. though not connected to any other mainland, you can be transported north to lleyndell divine bridge via a treasure chest. to reveal the details and topography of the whole limgrave region, you'll need to find three map fragments at the steles located in west limgrave, east limgrave, and the weeping peninsula. the weeping peninsula map fragment is located just south of the castle morne rampart site of grace, where a golem will start firing giant arrows from afar. if you follow the direction from that site of grace, you'll be able to see as soon as you pass the stone wall next to it. although the weeping peninsula does not contain a legacy dungeon, it is home to a few field bosses, one of which is located in an evergaol—you'll need one stonesword key to access this boss. boss name reward 1 erdtree avatar opaline

peninsula is home to many interesting locations, enemy camps, and other points of interest that you can discover in your journeys. though they differ in the enemies and treasure found within, each place has something worth discovering. click on a point of interest to jump to the sections below that explain them in greater detail, including the enemies you'll face and secrets you can find. point

shard (spell) sorceress sellen 15 morne poison field putrid undead, toxic slime, giant crab golden rune 4, enemies: soldiers of godrick npcs: irina the first point of interest in the weeping peninsula, the bridge of sacrifice, connects west limgrave and south limgrave. here you'll find soldiers of godrick patrolling about the bridge. while you can completely dodge them to get across, the loot (smithing stone 1 and stonesword key) might come in handy for you early in the game. head past the bridge, and you'll soon encounter irina —a blind young girl who's part of the local royal family. she'll ask you to deliver a letter to her father in castle morne at the southernmost tip of the region. enemies: troll, soldiers of godrick, attack dogs, misbegotten a caravan just like the one you'd see roaming about the main road in west limgrave. this one, however, was abandoned—with several corpses of soldiers of godrick laying around the vicinity. be wary of the troll on the right side. you might be able to sneak past the enemies here, though there is a scarab containing an ash of war - mighty shot nearby. enemies: poison plants, foot soldiers, attack dogs this lookout tower is home to a small group of soldiers serving as scouts for the nearby camp. watch out for the soldier of godrick equipped with a ballista atop the tower—there is a chest containing a hand ballista with some bolts next to him. enemies: demi-humans, demi-human chief, demi-human queen this ruined settlement contains many demi-human enemies, led by a demi-human queen. she can be a tough fight when you're dodging not only her spells but also her minions. try to approach the battle from the front, clear out the demi-humans and the demi-human chief, and lure the enemies inside with throwing knives or a bow before engaging the queen. you should have the spirit calling bell at this point, so use whichever ashes you have to help you. once you've defeated her, make sure to go back to the low-walled ruins at the front. use torrent and jump behind it; a cellar here contains a shield of the guilty inside a chest. enemies: alabaster lord, gravity acolytes the crater-pocked glade is accessible from the castle morne rampart site of grace. you'll need to use torrent to get up to the cliff using the nearby spiritspring. head north, and you'll soon find another site of grace from here. there are lots of gravity acolytes here, so summoning ashes is recommended. the alabaster lord is the real challenge; watch out for when he casts his purple orb. this spell pulls you in as he's winding his sword to hit you. there is no notable loot here outside of the stonesword key you can find a little north of the meadow. enemies: wolves oridys's rise is a tower you'll see as soon as you jump using the spiritspring right next to the castle morne rampart site of grace. a pack of wolves hangs around the entrance, clear them quickly before heading into the tower. the tower is protected by a sigil that blocks the front entryway. this mini side quest requires you to seek out three wise beasts to disable the sigil and go inside. though vague, the puzzle is quite simple—you'll need to kill the spirit turtle roaming around the tower. the first turtle is in the opposite direction of the statue, close to the earlier pack of wolves. the second turtle is just to the left of the tower, next to the steps. the final turtle, though invisible, is actually in the middle of the shallow pond to the right of oridys's rise. once you've done that, head inside the tower and loot the memory stone from inside the chest. this item increases your character's spell slot, which is quite handy if you're going for sorcery or faith-based build. enemies: frenzy rats, frenzied commoners though it is two points of interest next to each other, this former village and church are only home to several frenzied rats and commoners. they are weak and easy to defeat. however, the loot you can get from here is excellent for early-game content. grab the sacred tear from inside the callu baptismal church; this will strengthen your flask of crimson tears and flask of cerulean tears when you use it at a site of grace. you can also find a flame crest wooden shield and a the flame of frenzy spell in the middle of the village. enemies: demon bats located directly west of the ailing village, you'll need to maneuver the giant tombstones protruding from the canyon walls to make your way down. be careful of the lightning strike once you're down there; the demon bats will also make it difficult for you to loot the lightning strike spell on the floor. enemies: rats, pages x2 these ruins are situated on the weeping peninsula's western landmass, just south of the church of pilgrimage. finding these ruins should be easy, as it is next to the main field where you can find the walking mausoleum. there are rats and two pages in the vicinity. clear them before heading down the cellar to pick up the winged scythe from the chest. there is also a scarab holding a divine fortification spell on top of nearby ruins. enemies: skeletons churches in elden ring is always a good place to find great loot, especially ones that make your flasks stronger. here you'll find another sacred tear next to the site of grace. the skeletons outside shouldn't be a problem; make sure to finish them off once you've killed them the first time; otherwise, they'll come back to life. there is also a gilded iron shield to loot, and if you head over to the northern cliffs, you can find a sliver of meat and three bewitching branches. enemies: mausoleum guards the fourth church of marika serves as another site of grace location with a sacred tear . besides the patrolling guards protecting the walking mausoleum, there are few enemies here. enemies: foot soldiers, soldiers of godrick, godrick knight like the forest lookout tower, the tower of return is another lookout, but this time is home to several soldiers of godrick and a godrick knight on horseback. try to lure the godrick knight further away from the tower and fight him while riding torrent—though be wary of the angles as atop the tower is another foot soldier using a ballista. clearing the enemies will reward you three great dragonfly heads, but most importantly, the chest at the top. this chest is a transporter trap that will teleport you to the divine bridge in lleyndell . while you can teleport your way back once you active the site of grace on the bridge, defeating the golem that's further up will reward you with a smithing shard 5 and a blessed dew talisman. this fight will be tricky since your weapon will be weak when you first access this area, and the golem can two-shot you with his attacks. but as long as you keep hammering his ankles and keeping the distance close, the fight should be relatively straightforward. be wary of his ground fire attack; this is one attack of his that you'd want to back away from. enemies: lots of undead npcs: isolated merchant one of the many isolated merchants you'll find in the game, this one sells various items that can be incredibly crucial during your journey in the lands between. one of which is the lantern for 1800 runes—this key item is an exceptional alternative to the torch, as the lantern can be equipped to your waist, allowing you to save an equipment slot for a shield or another weapon on your left hand. he also sells different arrows, stonesword keys, lost ashes of war, and the fan-favorite zweihander. there are tons of undead nearby, but they are mostly found on the western shore of the weeping peninsula, so you don't have to worry about being attacked while shopping here. enemies: marionnette fighters, giant magic head sphere npcs: sorceress sellen (chained in the cellar) these ruins can be found directly southwest of the fourth church of marika, right below the cliffs. you should be able to see the marionnette fighters roaming around the area from that vantage point. the entry to the cellar is blocked by some giant magic head sphere that will shoot out spells to the sky, raining down devastating magic in its vicinity. try to battle the fights around the ruins first, as the magic sphere will attract them towards you. once you have defeated all the enemies, you can head down to the cellar to speak to the npc who looks a lot like sorceress sellen - but she can't be interacted with until you undertake sellen's quest much later in the game. ensure to loot the ambush shard sorcery spell on a corpse inside as well. enemies: putrid undead, toxic slime, giant crab just to the northeast of castle morne lies a large poison swamp with two jutting rocks, and the place is crawling with putrid undead that will try to shamble around and lunge at you or cause poison goo to explode outward from them. luckily, as long as you stay mounted, the poison field will deal no damage to you, and you can weave in and out to deal with the shambling undead and outmanuever a giant crab that burrows up. however, there's not much in the way of rewards other then gaining toxic mushrooms from the dead or poisonbloom growing here - though the second jutting rock does have a golden rune 4 at the base of one of the crucified bodies screaming out. you can also ride just north of the poison field to find a glowing scarab that can be killed for a poison mist incantation spell. as you explore this region, you may come across several scarabs scampering away. some of them will refill your flask of tears, but others can reward you with special items: reward: ash of war - mighty shot cross the bridge south of limgrave into the weeping peninsula and take the main road through the large gorge past a ruined caravan full of enemies. just past the misbegotten the road will slope upwards toward the castle morne ramparts, and you'll find the scarab here on the road. reward: divine fortification spell crossing over to the west side of the weeping peninsula is a large valley, and along its north side between two churches is the tombsward ruins. just to the side of the main ruined walls are several larger ruined chunks, and a scarab lurks upon one of them. reward: poison mist spell heading south along the main road to castle morne, you can find a large poison field to the northeast of the castle. look for a small clearing north of the poison to spot a smoldering scarab - but be wary when you attack it, as it will explode upon death. here you’ll find all of the secrets found so far in the weeping peninsula (south limgrave) area. as soon as you enter the western portion of the weeping peninsula, you'll hear the sounds of a ringing bell from the distance. these sounds originate from the giant mausoleum roaming on four legs with a bell attached to its stomach. attacking the legs where you spot the skull-like barnacles will soon cause it to weaken and becomes stationary, allowing you to enter the inside of the building. you are able to duplicate any boss remembrances that you obtained from bosses, but it is limited to one use per mausoleum—so pick wisely! at the top of the tower of return in the far southwest corner of the weeping peninsula is a chest - but like the one in west limgrave's dragon-burnt ruins, it's a trap to send you to a distant region. luckily, you won't be in any danger once you appear on the other side - unless you choose to seek it out. you'll appear on top of a divine bridge in leyndell, royal capital - far to the north of the weeping peninsula. it's so far north that you won't be able to get her normally for quite a long time, and the lift behind you can only be activated from below. a site of grace can teleport you back as soon as you rest at it, but there's a reward waiting ahead... through the large archway you'll spot a fallen golem that will immediately rise as you draw close. unlike the damaged golems in west limgrave, this one has a lot more health and does even more damage than the heavy hitting ones you've seen previously. to the right of the golem is a chest you can open to find a blessed dew talisman, which is a great item to have early, but you'll likely be killed trying to open it unless you manage to kill the golem at your low level. it's not impossible, but you'll need to perfectly time dodges and watch for the golem slamming its halberd into the ground repeatedly, or spewing fire from its chest./n stormveil castle is the first legacy dungeon you can encounter in elden ring, and contains many challenges and dangers, as well as a demigod boss . this page will contain walkthrough and guide information on how to reach stormveil castle, all the treasures and items that can be found inside, tips for navigating the dungeon, and how to defeat its fearsome bosses . how to get to stormveil castle margit the fell omen boss fight stormveil castle walkthrough stormveil cliffside rampart tower liftside chamber godrick the grafted boss fight stormveil castle cleanup the legacy dungeon stormveil castle is easy enough to find, as you can spot it high on the cliffs as soon as you leave the tutorial dungeon at the stranded graveyard and enter limgrave. getting to it is another matter. taking the roads to the east, you can enter the large storm gate, but be prepared for a host of godrick soldiers and crossbowmen waiting behind barricades, as an imposing stonedigger troll jumps down from the ruins above the small canyon to ambush you. it's a rough fight, and you may want to bypass it either by racing through on torrent, or traveling a bit farther east to find a spiritspring jump point to get onto storm hill. past the narrow canyon entrance, you can find a site of grace at the scavenger's shack, where you'll meet the character roderika . she'll give you a bit of information on the castle, as well as the spirit jellyfish ashes to hold onto, and may eventually move on to the roundtable hold. further up the road are more patrols of soldiers leading to the main stormveil castle gate, but the entrance is heavily fortified by rows of barricades lined by soldiers, with a ballista manned at the tunnel entrance. it has incredible range and power, so it may be best to gallop on torrent into the dense woods on the left as you make your approach, then race forward along the castle walls to ambush and destroy the ballista, before taking out the rest of the soldiers in smaller groups. entering the tunnel, you can find one last site of grace before you must fight the boss that guards the entrance to stormveil castle proper - margit the fell omen. margit the fell omen is something of a skill check in elden ring, as he's way more imposing and fearsome than any mini boss you've likely fought in the smaller dungeons of west limgrave . if you've been avoiding these places or raced straight here, he may prove to be insurmountable, and it is highly recommend you gain experience and gear by clearing out the smaller dungeons of west limgrave before attempting this fight. margit is a wary fighter, but don't let his slow pacing or knobbled cane fool you, he can hit incredibly hard - not just with his cane, but with his ability to summon holy weapons at a moment's notice to strike you with. you'll also be fighting on a somewhat narrow bridge, with chasms on both sides that he can and will knock you off of if you don't position yourself with your back to the middle as much as possible. as stated previously, margit can sometimes be very cautious unlike many main bosses , and may slowly strafe you at a distance, inviting attacks. this can be a good opportunity for ranged and magic attacks, but you'll need to be ready to move at a moment's notice - particularly when he summons holy daggers to toss your way. as you draw close, be prepared for several types of attacks he can unleash: getting close often prompts him to use a rapid upward swing from his staff that's difficult to anticipate, and can still deal damage if your shield isn't fully absorbing hits. he'll follow this up by slamming the weapon down again, but after a short delay - meaning you can quickly get behind him and counter with a few blows while his animation plays out - just watch for a quick tail lash follow up if you stay behind him for too long. he can employ a series of swings from his preferred weapon in horizontal sweeps (which can be parried if you're timing things right), and often combine them by summoning a holy dagger to slice at a faster rate, before jumping backwards and throwing it at you. he may also simply performing a retreating swing from his staff as he jumps back to increase distance from you. other times, he may start to hold his staff high in one hand while walking forward before slamming it down vertically in front of him. one of his more iconic attacks is to slowly raise his cane above his head and hold it high with two hands. he'll wind it up with a long delay, and then finally send it crashing down fast in front of him - but you can dodge once the weapon is on its way down. if you retreat from this attack, he'll leap forward after smashing down and use a follow up attack to get close to you, but you can dodge roll behind his leaping swing. sometimes at range, he'll begin to jog forward, and jump high into the air to slam down with his cane like a speartip into the ground. it's a powerful move, but also easier to dodge and get behind him, giving you lots of time to attack him as he slowly removes the weapon from the ground. at around half health, he'll admit you have some strength, but summon a might holy hammer, and swing it in an arc in front of him to gain momentum to launch into the air, and slam it down on top of you. backpedal away from the initial swing, and wait until he's about to crash down to dodge out of the way of the hammer and retaliate - but be ready for followup dagger swings. he can also start to summon a longer golden sword blade, with more reach than his daggers, and can use it in conjunction with his cane to perform spinning combo slashes that are difficult to avoid, or end with a stab with his main staff weapon. margit can be very hard to predict which magical weapons he'll summon and how he'll incorporate them into his combo attacks, so you'll always want to have stamina in reserve to quickly block or dodge his next move. if you have an adequate absorbing shield, you can even perform guard counters, provided you make sure he's finished his combo strike before you launch your counter, or you'll likely take more damage once committed to the attack. take your time with this fight, as he moves slowly enough to give you time to watch his attack animations and get a feel for the right and wrong times to try your own attacks - and never get too greedy so you leave yourself open. melee fighters should back off every now and then to regain full stamina and wait for him to make the first move so you can react accordingly. get your hits in where you can to slowly whittle margit down, and he'll fall with enough practice, clearing the way to stormveil castle proper. starting from the stormveil main gate, go right down the staircase and loot the body to get a furlcalling finger remedy . as you go back up the stairs take a peek over the edge and you will see a wooden bridge along the wall. drop down and follow this path to the end to find a fire grease x2. drop down again into the grassy area, then exit the castle out of the hole in the castle wall on your left. return to the site of grace then go through the door on the left and speak to the npc who calls out to you from the corner. they will explain you have two ways to approach the keep: through the heavily fortified main gate, or through a hidden opening in the side. at this point it may be possible to run through the front gate gauntlet with a little determination, but it would be a waste of time and you would miss a lot of items. so this guide will be taking the side path for maximum loot acquisition. taking the npc's advice, exit out the opening on the left side of the room and grab the golden rune [1] on the cliff's edge. turn around and use the rocks to jump up onto the hole in the castle wall where you can find a ruin fragment x3. use the path along the wall to reach the cliff on the other side. here you will find a wall with a hole smashed in it. climb up the debris on your right to reach a cliff above you where you can find a smithing stone [2]. carefully drop down to the grassy area below where you will be attacked by a storm hawk. once you kill it walk forward to the cliff's edge but instead of dropping down, go right to find a small path that leads up to a crumbling watchtower. you will meet the npc from before here, and he will give you a grace mimic . look down and you will see a site of grace below. drop down and rest if you need, but before progressing we need to go back and grab a few more items. go left from the site of grace following the cliff's edge down to a clearing where you will see three stormhawks. approach them carefully or you may be overwhelmed. when you defeat them you can claim the smithing stone [3] they were guarding. continue following the path down to encounter two more stormhawks, then past them is a dead-end where you can find bolts x 10. return to the site of grace from before and prepare for the next zone. from here we can finally get into the castle proper. walk up to the wooden staircase in front of the site of grace, keeping an eye on the guard who is patrolling the tower at the top. wait for him to turn his back, then stealthily ascend the stairs, trying to reach and kill him before he can alert the other guards. there are two more soldiers, one in the tower and one around the corner. beware their quick thrusting attacks and ranged air slash ability. defeat them and walk around the tower to find a golden rune [2] on the other side. enter the tower to get inside the castle wall. inside you will encounter two sleeping guards who can be easily dispatched as they try and get up. there is a staircase on your left, but instead walk underneath it and sneak your way around the barrels to get a backstab on the guard patrolling this area. once he is defeated you can freely loot the hookclaws in the back corner of this room. return to the staircase and make your way up to the platform at the top. enemies will throw firebombs at you to ignite the barrels at the top of the stairs, so roll backwards before the explosion sets off, then run up the stairs and kill both of the guards before they can pelt you with more bombs. on this platform you will find a locked door we won't be able to access for now, but look to the right of the door to find throwing dagger x5. turn around and go up the next staircase where you will enter a hall with a smoldering butterfly x3 and more explosive barrels for you to dodge. kill the enemy ahead, then smash the debris behind you to uncover another set of staircases. kill the enemy at the top of the stairs, then drop down to grab the golden rune [2] on the platform below you. go back up the stairs and open the black door on the right wall of the top platform. entering this room will trigger a cutscene where the door is closed behind you, locking you in with a black knight. the knight has a large shield, but his slow moves make him highly susceptible to backstabs. be careful, though. there’s a good chance he’ll use his ashes of war storm stop skill to call up a gust that can do severe damage if you’re not playing a highly armored character. once the knight is dead you can explore the room and grab the rusty key and curved sword talisman . return to the platform with the locked door, but don't use the key just yet. instead look for the huge hole in the wall to the left of the door. jump up into the hole in the wall where you will find st. trina's arrow x10. target the enemy below and execute them with a falling attack. beware another spear wielding enemy to your left who will pelt you with firebombs, and a third who will come down the ladder at the top of the staircase. once all the enemies are dispatched climb the ladder and reenter the room through the hole in the wall at the top. return to the locked door from before and unlock it with the rusty key , then climb the ladder inside to reach the platform above. upon exiting the door take a right walk toward the platform ahead of you, taking care to jump across the gap rather than fall down. kill the resting enemy in the middle of the platform, then carefully cross the wooden plank to reach another enemy and a fire grease . note the slightly elevated wooden platform to the right of the plank. run and jump to it to access a door to the exterior. here you will encounter a shielded soldier. stand your ground and try not to get knocked off the platform. walk down the stairs ahead and enter the door on your left, where you will find another soldier and the brick hammer . do not drop down from this point, instead turn around and walk all the way back to the ladder room. this time take the left path, but beware the enemy waiting to ambush you just before the stairs ahead of you. kill the enemy and ascend the stairs to find another enemy resting at the top, and a silver-pickled fowl foot behind some boxes. head out the door to an exterior platform where you will see a large staircase. don't ascend it just yet, instead walk along the edge of the wall to find mushroom x3 around the corner. walk back to the stairs and climb up to find a large door leading to the inside of the castle, guarded by a halberd knight. try and sneak up on him and execute a backstab to get the upper hand. beware his large sweeping attacks and keep in mind that he can leap long distances to kill you as you attempt to heal. once he is defeated you can enter the elevator room and take the staircase up. the elevator is not active yet, but you can jump over the elevator shaft to reach the drawstring fire grease x2 on the other side. jump back across the gap and enter the armory room ahead where you can rest at a new site of grace. from this we can finally access the real core of stormveil, but before that we have some hidden items to collect. begin by ascending the second staircase outside the site of grace room. you will encounter a spear and shield enemy and another soldier shooting you with a crossbow from a platform across the room. you can run into the nearby hallway to avoid the crossbow enemy, then use guard counters to break down the shield enemy. go back to the elevator and jump on the pulley system to cross over to the other side, kill the soldier, and loot the throwing dagger x5. go back into the hallway and walk all the way around to find a door that exits onto a exterior platform. crouch and carefully walk around the pedestal to the left of the door to avoid alerting the guard on patrol. climb up the stairs on the opposite side of the platform and stealth kill him, then go kill the other sleeping guards one by one. notice the sandbags piled up next to the castle wall. use them to climb up onto the wall, then go right along the ledge until you are close enough to jump onto the crumbling adjacent tower. jump inside and fall down to find a stonesword key . jump out the window and land on the rooftop below where you will encounter an armored stormhawk. this hawk is just as relentless as the previous ones, and it can also spit fire out of its helmet. trying to pick a spot to attack is hard because of its erratic movement, so your best bet is to shield block one of its heavy strike and counter strike in the small opening. defeat the hawk and claim the dazing cross-legged gesture on the other side of the roof. look at the wall where the stormhawk was perched and you will notice an adjacent tower with a ledge you can hop up onto. jump on and walk all the way around the tower to find a small wooden walkway that gets you access to a platform containing a smithing stone [2]. go back around the tower but instead of going back to the roof where you battled the stormhawk you will want to jump onto the adjacent rooftop with the crumbled pillar on it. you will want to use that pillar to reach the ledge above you, then walk around it where you will find yet another accessible rooftop. this roof is teeming with soldiers, so be careful how you approach. i would recommend starting by killing the sleeping soldier on the right, then hiding behind the tower to protect yourself from the three crossbow soliders on the left. let them come to you and dispatch them one by one. once they are all dead climb to the top of the tower above you and loot the claw talisman . take the ladder back down, then retrace your steps all the way back to the rooftop with the crumbling pillar on it. you will see a gap in between this roof and the one where you fought the stormhawk. heal to full hp then drop down to the courtyard below where you will find a stonesword key door and a somber smithing stone [2]. use the stonesword key you recently got to unlock the door, but be careful of the two axe soldiers waiting inside. draw them out into the courtyard one by one if you need a little room to dodge around. their slam attacks are very slow, so you can easily get bnehind them and execute a back stab. inside the room you will find the hawk crest wooden shield , misericorde , and the iron whetblade . go back into the courtyard and go in the other door you haven't explored yet. inside is a dining hall guarded by a grafted scion, but we don't want to battle it yet so immediately run to the other side of the room and enter the small room on the other side which contains two dogs and the crimson hood atop a pile of bodies. exit this room and enter the door immediately to your left where you will find the first elevator that takes you back up to the spot of grace. if you are low on flasks you can rest, but we still have a little more jumping to do. go back up to the rooftop and jump across the towers and make your back back to the rooftop with the crumbling pillar. climb up like you are going back to the rooftop where you got the claw talisman, but instead drop down to the platform below you, then drop down again onto a large open rooftop where you will see two soldiers in the distance. sneak up behind the weaker one and backstab them so you can take on the halberd knight one on one. just like before your strategy is going to be to strafe in an attempt to execute a backstab, and guard countering when you see an opening. just keep in mind that most of his attack patterns have two parts, so don't get caught attacking too early. cross the wooden bridge to access another rooftop where you will meet two more soldiers, and find the nomadic warrior's cookbook 10 on a wooden platform. go down the ladder on the other end of this rooftop where you will encounter two more soldiers,, then cross another wooden bridge where you will meet another halberd knight as well as a sword knight in hiding. approach carefully or you will quickly get overwhelmed by the two of them (the halberd knight dropped a banished knight helm (altered) for me here, but i cannot confirm if that is a guaranteed drop at this time). grab the festering bloody finger from the nearby body, then descend the ladder nearby to another lower platform. follow this path forward and around the corner where you will find arrow x10 and another ladder you can go down. on this final platform you will find a golden rune [4] and a blocked doorway, which we will get to later. for now, teleport back to the spot of grace and we can go take on the scion. take the elevator back down to the dining hall and prepare to take on the scion. this enemy is a pain because of his multi-hit attacks, erratic movements, and large shield, but it is just as susceptible to guard counters as anyone else. keep in mind that most of its attacks feature two to four strikes, so wait until the final attack before countering (usually denoted by it being a little slower and stronger). anytime it rears up on its back legs the scion is about to unleash a flurry of attacks so back off or roll away quickly and wait it out. rinse and repeat this process and you should be able to take it down fairly easily. once it is dead you can grab the highland axe from underneath the large painting, as well as the stanching boluses off the table in the side of the room. from here we can go a few different places, but we will begin by going into the kitchen to the left of the giant wall painting. quickly take out the group of weak enemies resting in front of the fire, then take on the soldier who runs down from the platform overhead. loot the exalted flesh under the platform, the ascend the stairs where you will run into another soldier with a shield. inside the room at the top of the stairs is yet another halberd knight. crouch, wait for him to turn his back, then sneak up to start the fight with a backstab before executing the same careful strategy as always to defeat them. loot the chest at the front of the room to get the mimic's veil item. exit this room, but instead of going straight ahead into the next room climb the sandbags on your left to hop the wall and go onto the platform on the other side. sneak up on the enemy overlooking the ledge, then loot the nearby gold-pickled fowl foot . follow the nearby wooden walkway to find a ladder at the end. climb up onto the roof and walk forward to the edge of the roof where you can see a wooden balcony below with an enemy on it. drop down and kill the enemy, then open the nearby door to open a shortcut back to the kitchen. before going back, go through the door the soldier was guarding to find a stonesword key and a chest containing a pickled turtle neck . take the shortcut back to the halberd knight room and proceed through the doorway we ignored earlier, following it all the way to the end and killing the resting axe soldier. go through the nearby door to find yourself in a cozy room where you can find a golden rune [2]. exit out the door on the opposite side to find yourself on a rampart patrolled by a sword knight and a weaker soldier enemy with a torch. as always you want to crouch and wait for them to turn their backs, then sneak up and kill the weaker soldier before taking on the knight. once they are defeated you can proceed down the rampart where you will see a ladder you can climb on the left and a doorway at the end. we are going to start by heading for the door which will lead you to a chapel where you can meet a sorcerer named rogier who will ask you to kill godrick and sell you spells. once you are done speaking to him you can head back to the ladder and climb up onto yet another roof. begin by dropping off the side of the roof opposite the ladder to loot the kukri x5 below. drop into the chapel through the window then return to the ladder and pass through the bell tower to find the golden rune [2] on the connected roof before heading up the nearby stairs. here you will encounter some very dangerous stormhawks that throw explosive barrels at you, triggering other explosives in the area. you want to approach them slowly to bait out their barrel toss so you can fight them without worrying about getting blown up. as always, wait out their erratic swooping attacks before guard countering. turn around and head toward the dead end behind the stairs to find a smithing stone [2] (beware yet another stormhawk ambush) then follow the path forward through one last stormhawk before reaching the rampart tower spot of grace yet again. we are nearly done exploring this area, but we still have to open up that second elevator before we can fully proceed. go back to the rampart with the barrel chucking stormhawks and find the balcony that overlooks the ocean. peer down over the edge and you will see a platform below you can drop to. from here you can drop again to a thin ledge along the castle wall, the onto a smashed tower where you will find a marred wooden shield . continue dropping until you land on a ledge made of crumbling rocks which will break and send you plummeting down to an area far below. immediately you will notice a scarab on the nearby cliff's edge, so be sure to run and kill it before it can escape to claim the ash of war: storm assault . keep following this cliff, but go into stealth before you reach the open area ahead because there is a crucible knight patrolling the area. he is very tough to defeat at this point because of his high health pool and resistance to normal cheesy strategies like backstabbing. your best bet if you want to beat him is to parry his sword swings. however, when he reaches half health he transforms and opens up a new set of powerful abilities like a diving attack and fire breath. if you manage to defeat him you will get the aspects of the crucuble: horns . if you are up to the challenge feel free to practice against him, otherwise just run and grab the somber smithing stone [2] he is guarding and then sprint past him through the crumbling archway and into the tower beyond where you will find the second elevator back to the spot of grace. finally we are ready to proceed for real. return to the room where you battled the scion and exit out the door opposite the kitchen to enter a new room that leads to the courtyard. use the door on the left to get onto the wooden rafters above where you can find an arrow x10. the next room is the courtyard, which is absolutely packed to the brim with soldiers, archers, and fire spitting turrets. the name of the game here is careful, but really how you want to approach this is up to you. if you feel confident enough to run in there and kill them all as a group feel free, otherwise you can try and draw them out slowly and dispatch them one by one. whatever you do make sure you fully clear all of them out before taking on the larger enemy and the dog that is behind the line of soldiers. once the coast is clear enter crouch and sneak around the large enemy and position yourself on the staircase behind him so you can approach and backstab him. his attacks are strong but slow, so execute the normal cheese plan of backstabbing, or do some guard counters to break him down. once he is dead we are free to explore the courtyard! check the grounds as well as both of the wooden guard towers and you will find: fire arrow x12, a wooden greatshield , a pike , magic grease , golden rune [1] [2] and [4], furlcalling finger remedy , mushroom x8, and smoldering butterfly x5. you will notice a path leading down to the main gate, but i would recommend just ignoring that until after you defeat the boss. check the corner near the doorway into the courtyard and you will see a cellar leading to a room with some rats, a fireproof dried liver , and another stonesword key door. use the other key we found earlier to open it up and loot the chests inside to get the godslayer's seal and godskin prayerbook . near where the giant enemy was resting is a small room containing a special painting. next head up the stairs behind the large enemy where you can find a smithing stone [1] and finally (finally!) the next spot of grace in a room at the top of the stairs. from here we are within striking distance of the boss room, and in fact we can even take back way to get there. pull the lever next to the elevator to call it down, then take it up to reach a high rampart that over looks the courtyard. go through the door at the end of the path and you will find yourself in a long room populated by magic jar enemies, including one large jar warrior hiding in the back. try to draw out the large jar and deal with him first. as you may expect his attacks are strong and slow, so just stay out of range to bait out an attack, then run in for one or two attacks when he is vulnerable. the main attack you need to look out for is his spin which he winds up by turning his body slightly. kill off the smaller jars afterwards then look in the corner where the large jar was hiding to find two cracked pot . look down the path and you will see it has been split in two with two higher paths and one leading down the middle. if you look down you will see another scarab, which you can kill to get the ash of war: stormcaller . grab the kukri x8 off the left high path, then drop back down and go through the door at the end of the room. here you will find the boss door as well as another spot of grace. activate the spot of grace and rest if you need, but it isn't boss time just yet. instead take the other path where you will see a giant and some soldiers waiting. dealing with the giant is easy, but the soldiers can be pesky in this encounter. try to draw them underneath him and it is possible that he will just kill them with his slam attack. otherwise, try and bait the soldiers into the smaller hallway area the giant cannot get into. once you have the giant in a one on one, stand in front of him until he starts up an attack, then run underneath him and strike the back of his legs. this will almost always cause him to miss his attack, allowing you some free hits. just look out for his foot stomp which can deal big damage in an area of effect. once the enemies are defeated you can grab the smithing stone [2] from the end of the alleyway nearby, then loot the golden seed from under the tree up ahead. look to the right and you will see an item sitting behind the line of stormhawks. carefully walk up and grab it without alerting the hawks to get the golden rune [2]. then you can kill them to access the staircase they are guarding and reach the smithing stone [2] that is atop them. finally go into the room near the tree and meet a warrior named nepheli loux who wants to help you defeat godrick, as well as a smithing stone [1]. turn around and head back to the jar warrior room. climb up onto the wooden awning where you found the kukri earlier and use it to jump to the thin railing that runs along the wall. follow this ledge to reach some open windows on the wall. go through and windows and head forward where you will encounter a powerful knight and his stormhawk. try and deal with the hawk first to simplify the encounter, then deal with the knight with the usual combo of sneaky strikes and guard counters. grab the lump of flesh that they were guarding and head back towards the windows. go through the door near the windows and up the stairs inside to reach another wooden platform above the jar warrior room. cross the gap to the right of the door to get a smithing stone [2], then jump back and take the path up where you can loot a golden rune [2] and a smithing stone [1]. go through the nearby door and take the stairs down, but beware the group of enemies resting on the platform below. thankfuilly they are all weak guards, so clear them out then grab the manor towershield from under the staircase, then exit out onto the balcony. here you will find a smithing stone [3] and a message on the ground hinting that you should look down. you will see a series of platforms you can drop onto, so follow them all the way to the bottom where you will find an accessible tower and a golden rune [5]. pass through the tower to find yourself on a balcony overlooking a deep pit. grab the rainbow stone x5, then go forward and up the stairs to reach a door that leads back to the spot of grace. with that shortcut unlocked it is time to venture into that pit. go back to the corpse where you got the rainbow stone and you will see a small awning you can use to reach the platform on the far side of the room. jump across and go into the tunnel where you can find an arteria leaf , and a bat waiting in ambush. drop down again where two more bats await. you can deal with them in mostly the same way you deal with the stormhawks, guard counters are always effective! use the nearby rafters as a bridge to reach the item on the other side, a smithing stone [2]. continue carefully dropping down until you reach the bottom of the room, where you will immediately find a golden rune [2]. start walking down the path, careful not to get overwhelmed by the rats that are creeping around, including one powerful large rat who can drop a rune arc . past the rats on the left is poisonbloom x3, and on the other side of the wall is another scarab you can kill for the spell rancorcall . as stated by the warning, if you drop down into the swampy area below you will trigger a mini-boss that may be too powerful for you at this point. it is a massive snake-like creature with large sweeping attacks and powerful magic. however with a 100 physical block shield and a little determination, it is very possible. the enemy telegraphs its attacks pretty obviously, so manage your stamina and be ready to block or dodge roll when you see it move to attack. you want to stand somewhere around its belly area to avoid its forward smashing attacks and get hits in safely. when it spins around and charges at you with its mouth open you need to dodge away or else get caught in its mouth and take on massive damage. when the monster glows gold it is entering its second phase with a magic explosion, so back off to avoid the area damage. if you manage to defeat the spirit you will be rewarded with a golden seed and some loot including a stonesword key , throwing dagger x8, and smoldering butterfly x3. continue up the path to find a massive skull and one more item, the prince of death's pustule . from here you can access a ladder that will take you back to the dining hall area. with that in the books it is offically boss time. teleport to the secluded cell site of grace and get ready. godrick the grafted is the first of the main bosses you will face in elden ring. he is distinguished by his twisted body which is made up of his servants limbs that he has grafted onto his own broken body. similar to the grafted scion, many of godrick's attacks are multi-part and multi-hit and he has some erratic movements that might catch you off guard. at half health he will graft a dragon head onto his arm that opens up some new attacks and modifies others with fire damage, so be careful if your shield does not have high fire resist. thankfully in both form's godrick's attacks are highly telegraphed, highly punishable, and he is generally slow moving which leads to a fairly easy fight once you've clocked the patterns. additionally, you can summon nepheli just outside the boss door if you need a little extra help (or a distraction). below is our general boss guide for besting godrick: in general you can stick relatively close to godrick if you are a melee attacker. his axe sweeps seem to have the biggest hitbox at the ends, so if you simply dodge roll toward godrick you will generally avoid them and end up in a good spot to punish. just remember that most of these are combo attacks, so be sure you manage your stamina and wait for the final attack if you plan to guard counter. if you are really unsure you can stay further out of range and wait for one of his slow overhead slam attacks which are easy to punish. another easy to see move is his aerial slam, which he telegraphs by grabbing the head of his axe with his off hand and leaping into the air. dodge as he comes down then get in a 2-4 hit combo while he is standing back up. another easy to punish move is his rolling slam. he will whip up the air around himself and then roll on the ground before leaping up into the air and slamming into the ground. simply walk toward him while he is in the air and he will sail right over you, letting you get in some back slashes while he is recovering. with nepheli's help you can easily stagger godrick and get a critical attack in. let her become his focus, then get in a bunch of side and back strikes while he is trying to strike her. just pay close attention to his movements because he can change focus back to you in an instant. with his dragon hand on there are only a few more moves to pay attention to. the most dangerous is probably the dragon breath which has a large area of effect and can hit multiple times. he telegraphs this one by raising the dragon head into the air as its mouth starts to leak flames. try to move to the side or back to avoid the brunt of the blast. the other is the fiery rock attack which he telegraphs by dragging the dragon head across the ground in a circle before blasting fiery rocks into the air. you can run toward him and let the rocks sail over your head, or simply run away and heal up while the rocks burn out on the ground. if you are feeling extra confident you can equip a gold-pickled fowl foot and use it before killing godrick to rake in some extra runes. defeating him will get you godrick's great rune and the remembrance of the grafted (see our guide on how to duplicate remembrances ). you can rest at the new spot of grace here to level up, then speak with the npc from earlier who is now stomping on godrick's grave. proceed up the path and enter the temple where you can find godrick's throne. go through the door to the right of the throne to reach a separate chamber where you can speak to a ghost who laments his failed service to some maiden. grab the shabriri grape next to him, then run to the temple exit which spits you out into the next area, liurnia of the lakes. finally it is time to gather the last of the loot in this castle, and activate godrick's great rune. teleport back to the liftside chamber spot of grace and head back to the heavily guarded main gate path that is accessible via the courtyard. this path is slightly easier to clear approached from the back, but it can still be a major pain. use stealth whenever possible, and do not aggro too many enemies at once. don't be afraid to back off if you need some extra space or need a moment to heal. when you reach the second set of stairs remember that this area is heavily guarded by two turrets and multiple firebomb throwing soldiers. if you have a ranged attack you can pick off the turret soldiers from afar, but otherwise just run as fast as you can to the bottom where you can escape their range. from here you can scale the rocks that are piled up against the wall, then jump over the gap to reach the posts where the turrets are located and kill their operators and find the arbalest . continue into the next large open area where you will encounter another large group of soldiers. similar to the courtyard you want to draw them out slowly and be sure not to aggro the large lion enemy waiting in the corner. if you look down the path you can see the front gate and the final spot of grace from here, but don't run toward it because there are more turrets hiding around the corner ready to blow you away. instead sneak along the right side wall where they can't see you, then climb up onto their platform and kill off all the turret operators, plus loot the smithing stone [2] and smithing stone [1] on their platform. once all the soldiers are dead you can finally loot all the items at the gate ( ballista bolt x3, golden rune [1], and golden rune [2] ). next, go into the door on the hillside next to the front gate to find the spot of grace, a golden rune [5], and the mechanism that opens the gate as well. go through the door behind the spot of grace to find a commoner's simple garb . with the spot of grace activated we can now go back and face off against that fearsome lion. this enemy is both powerful and agile so it can be hard to find your spot to strike it or heal. your best bet is to throw up your shield and wait out one of its slow arm-blade attacks, then get in one or two attacks during the recovery state. do not try and punish the quicker bite or off-claw swipes as they are usually followed up with another attack. it is kind of cheesy, but if you fight the lion on the nearby staircase its attacks will occasionally go right over your head. defeat it to get a somber smithing stone [1], beast blood , and old fang x2. now you can progress through the large doorway it was guarding and reach the final spot of grace for this dungeon as well as the boltdrake talisman . proceed down the path and onto the long bridge that leads to the divine tower in the distance. unsurprisingly, this bridge is guarded by some more powerful enemies. there are three of these mechanical giants in total, and the good news is that they can hit each other, so try and position yourself between the melee giants and the ranged giant so that they may get struck by incoming arrows. otherwise, deal with them how you would a normal giant: bait out an attack, then strike their ankles while they are preoccupied. once all three giants are dead you can grab the loot on the bridge. there is a warming stone sitting on a smashed in section near the middle of the bridge, and then a soft cotton and ash-of-war scarab waiting on end of the bridge behind the teleporter. however, i would take the teleporter first and go into the divine tower and come back before dropping down to collect that loot because scaling up the debris is annoying. use the teleporter to be taken across the bridge to the divine tower in the distance. the door will not be unlocked until you have defeated godrick. with the rune in hand, open the door and take the elevator up to the top where you can activate a spot of grace get the true godrick's great rune. this can be equipped at a spot of grace to access its power using a rune arc. similar to the ember in dark souls iii, using a rune arc will give you the great rune buff until you die. now that you've cleared all of stormveil castle, there are many directions you can take to continue your adventure: we highly recommend exploring the rest of limgrave if you haven't already to find every mini dungeon , world boss , and secret in the entire region. see our region overview guides for west limgrave , east limgrave , and the weeping peninsula you may also want to explore the siofra river well located in east limgrave's mistwood area, as the underground area is much larger than a dungeon, but presents a good and fairly linear challenge with a tough summonable boss. farther to the east lies the region of caelid , but newer players may find the area incredibly difficult and unforgiving with lots of large aggressive beats and poisonous areas. therefore, we recommend journeying north instead to the region of liurnia. it can be reached either through godrick's throne room, or by a secret path along the cliffs northeast of stormveil castle, below a broken bridge. liurnia is the home of the second legacy dungeon - the academy of raya lucaria, and boasts a very large region comprised of a large central flooded lake and two large ridgelines bordering the swamp. there are many more dungeons and points of interest here that should provide a bit more challenge than limgrave, and is a natural progression point. see our region overview guides for east liurnia and north liurnia , as well as the guide for entering and beating the academy of raya lucaria ./n siofra river is a larger dungeon found in the limgrave region in elden ring. it is an optional underground area more linear than the overworld, but keeps many of its core mechanics. the ability to ride torrent, fast travel and the restoration of flasks upon defeating enemy groups persist whilst underground. this page contains information on the location, walkthrough, and guide to traverse this area, locate all of its treasure, and tips to defeat the enemies within. looking for a particular section of this page? click one of the links below to jump to... how to get to siofra river siofra river walkthrough boss fight - dragonkin soldier continuing to explore boss fight - ancestor spirit enemies boss notable loot clayman, ancestral followers, rats, land octopuses ancestor spirit , dragonkin soldier dragon halberd , ancestral follower ashes , rune arc , golden seed just northeast of the minor erdtree east of mistwood, the siofra river well is denoted by a small domed building. on your approach, be cautious of the large bears roaming the nearby forest. as you enter, step onto the lift and ride it all the way down till you stop and reach a site of grace just to the right. heading down the slope, you’ll find a number of dewkissed herba plants. check behind one of the larger tombstones on the left-hand side of the slope to find a melted mushroom x2 . approaching the corpses in the water, you’ll be able to pick up multiple golden rune (1) . curving around the left-hand side of the structure, staying in the water, you’ll encounter a number of clayman with spears, but it allows you to bypass the larger group of clayman within the ruins straight ahead. within the ruins, there will be around a dozen of these same spearmen, with two spellcasters up the two sets of stairs to the left. all of these enemies are very slow-moving, and therefore any build will be able to get behind them for critical strikes, but in numbers their lunging spear attacks (which also damages and drags you towards them) can overwhelm easily. up the steps on the right is a corpse with a smithing stone . on the corpses lining the stairs on the left you’ll find more golden runes and rainbow stone . beyond the ruins, you’ll find a larger set of steps with blue flames next to a waterfall. on the left-hand side of the waterfall, you’ll find multiple silver firefly , but be careful - multiple clayman spearmen emerge from the ground around the water's edge. walking up the larger set of steps beyond the ruins, you’ll ride another lift up. you’ll emerge in a large canyon. turn left as you exit, down the path to enter a room on the left with preserving boluses on a corpse. heading down, multiple small crabs will be dotted around the flowing water, and behind the first large tombstone on the left (with a glowing white light) a giant crab will emerge, so prepare for that ambush. in the alcove from which it emerged you’ll find a corpse with some crab eggs . as you prepare to turn left at the end of the canyon, grab the grave glovewort on the right-hand side by the large stone column, then jump up the destroyed sections of the steps to reach the corpse and grab golden rune (3) . you’ll now note a site of grace just to the left as you turn out of the canyon, and will have a number of different paths available to take. the best to prioritize is to mount torrent, and from the site of grace head south-east towards the steps leading up to ruins. as you approach, grab the siofra river map off of the corpse by the right pillar, then curve around up the hill to the right to face off against three ancestral followers. tucked behind the rock directly in front of you is a corpse hanging off the ledge, which holds oldfang x2 . continue up the hill to grab an arteria leaf from one corpse and the inverted hawk heater shield from the other. backtrack down the hill and on the opposite side of the stone steps, you’ll note a lower level to drop down to. jump across to the platform underneath the steps and grab the horn bow from the corpse on the far side. continuing along the eastern edge of the area, you’ll come across a torrent jump point. spring up to land on a portion of the broken bridge overhead. you can collect ghost glovewort (3) and a stonesword key from the corpse around the back end. disembark torrent and drop down onto the various broken segments of the bridge where you had to jump across from the previously mentioned supplies, and by looping around and dropping down you can grab dwelling arrows x10 from the corpse you could see during the torrent jump. again looping around the eastern side of the map, you’ll approach a larger tree and a horned spirit will appear, often charging at you (which can easily stunlock you into an insta-kill scenario, so be careful to dodge roll or sprint away with torrent). defeat it; very easy to do so by continually circling it on torrent, and it can drop the great horned headband . on a corpse resting against the large tree is a golden rune (3) . progressing around, you’ll come across a roaming band of ancestral followers, as well as four additional on the ridge to the right. defeat them and then ignite the flame at the pillar on the ridge. you’ll then notice just to the north a ruined structure with two large braziers. at the top you’ll find a smithing stone . be wary - there are multiple ancestral followers in the wooded area to the west that, at longer range, fire empowered dwelling arrows that can deal devastating amounts of damage. clear out the spirits; the southernmost one tends to drop the fur raiment . by heading up the collapsed pillar in the center of this wooded area, you'll find a teleporter. by activating it, you'll be transported to nokron, the eternal city, a level above siofra river. head right from where you spawn to arrive at a large body of water with a hunched over large enemy in the center. a giant armored dragon-like warrior, the dragonkin soldier has a limited number of highly-damaging moves to look out for. thankfully, despite its name, the dragonkin soldier doesn't breathe fire. the majority of the attacks rely on sweeps with the arms and ground pounds. as such, you might feel inclined to utilize torrent in this fight, but realistically your best bet is to stay on the ground. the dragonkin soldier can swipe in all directions; left, right, back, or forward. the main strategy, particularly for melee builds, is to dodge-roll in the same direction as the swipes. if one hits you, the soldier won't pursue with a follow-up attack before you can recover, so don't begin to panic if you take a strike. you'll want to ensure, if you're a melee fighter, that you target any portion of the dragonkin soldier's body other than its chest. if the chest is where you are locked on, many of your swipes will often miss or clink against the armored belt portion of the soldier. at around 50% health, the soldier will emit a gigantic roar and will become far more agile and aggressive in its attacks, which negates the freedom and calm that the first phase of the fight allows you. it chases you down far more often, and in close proximity the soldier will slam its fists into the ground, creating a shockwave, but will emit a second shockwave as it wrenches its hands back out of the ground, so be careful. upon taking down the dragonkin soldier, you'll earn the dragon halberd weapon. backtrack to the original site of grace (siofra river bank) and follow the left wall, eventually curving up a path with some ancestral followers and a pillar to light at the dead end. head out into the main body of water and you’ll find a small island with another pillar to light, defended by three bow-wielding ancestral followers. at the north end of the body of water, you’ll find a second site of grace - worshipper’s woods. continuing north up the hill, you’ll pass three ancestral followers rhythmically stomping their feet, and across the field, you’ll note a pathway on the right-hand side leading to an additional two ancestral followers and some rats. riding torrent, you can break the rats away from the ancestral followers to make clearing them easier, but be cautious of these ancestral followers' tendency to charge you with their horns; a move that can repeatedly hit you in a stun-lock fashion, often nearly killing you outright. with them dealt with, light the pillar and then turn left and up the slope to find additional ancestral followers and rats (including a large rat) on the ridge by another pillar. the same strategy of drawing the rats away works here, and with them all gone you can light the final pillar, getting an alert that somewhere a lifeform has awoken. at the top of the hill, you'll climb a set of stone steps to another lift that is locked by an imp seal. using a stonesword key, you can activate the lift which will allow you to ride it up and unlock an alternate exit/entrance to siofra that places you in central caelid. as you head back towards hallowhorn grounds, you'll see a natural stone bridge to the right. head over it and you'll find a golden seed tree up and to the left, and following the narrow path to the right, you'll eventually arrive in a cave and find a corpse with a rune arc . backtrack to the stone flight of stairs near the site of grace, now with each of the pillars lit, and approach the horned remains at the other end of hallowhorn grounds. by interacting with the corpse, you'll be transported to a cave in front of a mist wall. passing through, you'll encounter the resurrected remains you interacted with prior. a giant reanimated deer imbued with spiritual energy, the ancestor spirit can appear far more daunting than it actually is. emerging through the mist wall you will be across the arena from the ancestor spirit, so you have time to summon any spirit ashes you wish. spirit ashes with ranged capabilities are recommended, as the ancestor spirit moves quickly around the arena and often prances into the air so melee spirits will be less effective. the ancestor spirit will often perform a three-bounce jump into the air, with the third bounce holding in the air for a moment before the ancestor spirit slams down creating a shockwave. it can also bounce into the air and then run through the air as it performs a strafing run, breathing blue fire. similar in style to the dragons in elden ring, but this strafing run attack is far easier to avoid, even without torrent. the breath of the ancestor spirit doesn't spread out horizontally once it hits the floor, so keep moving as the boss takes to the air and move in the opposite direction as it starts to fire. there are also a number of ram attacks that the ancestor spirit can perform, either a charge in a straight line or dashing to the side and diagonally thrusting with its horns. both will stagger or throw you into the air depending on your build but can be dodged through if you roll towards the spirit just as it reaches you. the ancestor spirit can also breathe its fire as it walks towards you, but this requires you to be in close proximity to its head, which rarely happens due to the maneuverability in play during this encounter. if you spend too long behind it, it will kick out with its hind legs which will knock you over if it connects. there are also two stomp attacks the spirit will utilize depending on your position in relation to it. at a distance, it can perform a charge 3-move combo, swinging its head from side to side before rearing up into the air and stomping down in a shockwave. if you're underneath it, it can rear up on its hind legs and slam down in a shockwave. upon defeating the ancestor spirit, you'll earn the ancestral follower ashes . /n east liurnia is one of the three areas that comprise the large region of liurnia of the lakes in elden ring. this page includes an overview of the area, including all main dungeons, bosses, loot, and secrets to find in this region. east liurnia is the first of the areas you're likely to encounter traveling to this region from limgrave - either through the back exit of stormveil castle after defeating godrick the grafted, or bypassing the castle along the cliff that runs alongside the ruined bridge northeast of the castle. while it is called east liurnia, in reality the area makes up much of the southern, eastern, and even a bit of the northern part of the liurnia region, as it encompasses the main eastern highway going north towards the academy town, the southern lakefront and swamp, and the northern passage known as bellum highway that leads to the grand lift of dectus that will take you to the altus plateau (if you have the dectus medallion). as a sub-region, east liurnia does not contain a legacy dungeon - as the academy of raya lucaria is located in north liurnia. however, there are many small dungeons, side quests , and roaming bosses to tackle. to reveal the details and topography of the whole liurnia region, you'll need to find three map fragments at the steles located in east liurnia, north liurnia, and the west liurnia. you can find the east liurnia map fragment not far north from the liurnia lakeshore site of grace, surrounded by wraiths that will try and ambush you from the ruins and trees that flank the main road traveling through the flooded zone. although the east liurnia does not contain a legacy dungeon, it is home to a few world bosses to be on the lookout for. boss name reward tibia mariner deathroot, skeletal bandit ashes adan, thief of fire (malefactor's evergaol) flame of the fell god spell erdtree

altus plateau as you explore the region of liurnia, you'll find various friendly (or seemingly friendly) faces you can find and speak to - and even buy and sell with to obtain unique wares. sorcerer thops - you'll find a meek wizard seeking refuge at the church of irith near the entrance to the region. he had the misfortune of being away from the academy of raya lucaria when they closed their gates, but may know how to get back in, and will sell you a few basic sorceries if you give him some runes. you can take up his offer to find a second academy key to bring to him. thops' sorceries glinstones pebble (1,000 runes) glintstone arc (1,500 runes) starlight (2,500 runes) hyetta the blind maiden - at the lake-facing cliffs, you may happen upon a blind girl who dreams of becoming a finger maiden. interestingly, she only appears after completing irina's questline in the weeping peninsula (and bears a striking resemblance). to follow the light of grace, she'll need some help in the form of shabiri grapes. should you choose to help her, you'll have to procure several grapes to help her as she moves from the cliffs to the purified ruins, the gate town bridge, and the bellum church. boc - if you helped boc the demi-human back in limgrave by getting him his sewing needle, you'll find him at the lake-facing cliffs, offering his services as a seamster to alter some of your armor for free of charge. eventually, he'll move to the east raya lucaria gate site of grace, north of the academy after teleporting across the bridge, and ask for a needle to alter the garments of demi-gods. nomadic merchant (lakeshore) - one of two merchants found in the east liurnia area, you'll find him resting by the liurnia lakeshore, offering a few notable wares like a lantern to help free your hands as you light up the darkened caves in this region. nomadic merchant's wares lantern (1,800 runes) nomadic warrior's cookbook 11 (1,500 runes) estoc (3,000 runes) astrologer's staff

latenna the albinauric - hidden at the slumbering wolf's shack, an area that can only be reached by clearing the lakeside crystal cave, latenna will refuse to cooperate with you at the first meeting, citing some strange people who came to get the location of a certain medallion from her. only by finding another albinauric named albus in the village of the albinaurics to the west - and gaining one half of the secret medallion - will latenna speak to you, and eventually offer herself up as a summonable spirit. jar-bairn - along the eastern cliffs of liurnia just south of the carian study hall is the small hidden town of jarburg. all the living jars you can meet here aren't aggressive, and a small living jar sitting on some steps in front of a house will talk to you about their dream of adventure - and has an associated quest that will advance much later in the game. miriel, pastor of vows - along the eastern highway in liurnia you can find the church of vows, where a giant turtle with a hat will dispense friendly advice, and safeguard the church - where you can offer up celestial dew to get absolution - rendering any npc you may have angered and turned hostile by accident back to a friendly status. in addition to this, miriel can also teach a few spells, and you can give them any books or scrolls you find of either sorceries or incantations. miriel's sorceries and incantations magic glintblade (3,000 runes) carian greatsword (10,000 runes) blessing's boon (4,000 runes) nomadic merchant (bellum highway) - another merchant found in east liurnia, this merchant can

tear here to prepare you for liurna better. you can also find the npc thops, a student at the academy of raya lucaria. you can unlock him as a merchant for only 10 runes—he sells a few low-level sorceries. check out our thops questline guide to learn more. if you head east from the lake-facing cliffs site of grace, you'll soon run into the liurnia highway south site of grace. keep moving south of the main road here and loot the treespear from inside the abandoned caravan chest. continuing the main path from church irith, you'll soon find a relatively small camp occupied by raya lucarian soldiers. not much to say about this location outside of the noble who drops the glintstone craftman's cookbook 1 when killed. this cookbook allows you to craft cuckoo glintstones. situated on a southern landmass of east liurnia, this small enemy outpost contains enemies imbued with fire incantations. the fire monks and fire acolytes that roam the surrounding area can be avoided if you approach the camp from the lakes, but there are still a couple of fire monks and one fire acolyte guarding the inside. there is a fire monk's prayerbook you can loot from a white corpse and a fire spur me gesture near the center of the camp. these ruins should be the first point of interest you come across in the shallow waters of liurnia lakes. if you follow the direction given by the liurnia lake shore site of grace, you'll run into the laskyar ruins site of grace. if you move closer to the gazebo in the middle of these ruins, several wraith summoners and a centipede wraith will spawn from the ground. be wary of the latter; their swift attacks can wear out your stamina even if you're blocking them. clear them out to safely loot the surrounding area. there is a ritual pot you can loot from a corpse on the northern part of the ruins. go slightly east of that, and you can find a set of stairs that leads to an underground cellar. open the door to the room and loot the chest to grab the wraith calling bell . go back to the gazebo and loot the smithing stone 3 from the nearby corpse. the waygate inside will teleport you to the entrance of the raya lucaria academy. directly east of the laskyar ruins lies other ruins on the eastern landmass of liurnia. now a tiny outpost for raya lucarian soldiers, there is an underground room that you can access from the upper portion of the ruins. while the enemies here are not serious threats, fighting them in such a small area can make you vulnerable to attacks from every side—especially with a few attack dogs in the mix. once you clear them out, head down and grab the shabriri's grape and the two fingers heirloom from the opened chest. the former is used to advance hyetta questline . this highway is the location of a constant battle between raya lucarian soldiers and noble undead. take advantage of their battle to grab the loot on the surrounding ground. be sure to head to the right near a tent with wooden carts and look for a corpse containing the lucerne halberd. if you get closer to the middle of the battle, a troll warrior will appear in the middle. if you do not engage any enemies, the royal lucarian soldiers will kill all of the noble undead, allowing you to deal with fewer enemies. if you veer left from the battlefield and go up, you'll find the highway lookout tower. tons of noble undead spawn as soon as you approach the tower; they vary between melee and sorcery users. at the top is a raya lucarian sorcerer that can shoot sorceries at you if you choose to fight the undead below the tower—it's a good idea to run past the enemies initially, get rid of the sorcerer above, and clear the rest after. aptly named jarbug, this isolated village is home to the living jars. located below the bridge that connects the carian study hall to the divine tower of liurnia, you can reach the jarburg by going down the several protruding tombstones on the side of the cliff to the south of the study hall. in addition to the variety of plants and flowers you can use for crafting, jarburg is an excellent place to grab cracked pots and ritual pots . above the village is where you can find iron fist alexander once you complete the festival in caelid's redmane castle . check out our alexander the iron fist questline guide to learn more. the artist's shack of liurnia is located at the end of the hill north of the carian study hall, right after the tibia mariner field boss. the painting associated with this location is titled "resurrection." head over to our painting locations and solutions guide for more detailed information. the knight you run into right before the shack drops the dragon cult prayerbook when killed. almost identical to the western fire monk camp, this outpost is occupied by fire monks, fire acolytes, and in addition, a few fire slugs near the precipice of the camp. there are tons of fire-related items you can loot up around here, including the fire, cleanse me incantation from one of the corpses inside the camp. be sure to hit the nearby site of grace—if you go back down the hill and head left, you'll soon run into the entrance of the ainsel river that a damaged golem guards. going the opposite direction of the ainsel river well, you'll soon run into a tower with a site of grace inside. while you gain immediate access to the carian study hall, the entirety of this location and its passageway to the divine tower of liurnia is locked until you acquire the carian inverted statue. to do so, you'll need to complete ranni the witch questline up to a certain point. check out our full guide on the questline to learn more. once you've done that, the entire study hall will now be upside down. the lift room consists of three magics hands; run past them to avoid getting cornered in the tiny room. going into the center of the hall will immediately cause preceptor miriam to appear. be wary of her long-range sorceries, especially her use of loretta's greatbow . depending on your level, she can two-hit you with this spell. fighting her before acquiring the carian inverted statue can be a pain for melee builds, as she will teleport further up the tower as you get closer. now with the tower upside down, she will stand in the middle platform, creating a chance for you to fight her from up close. she is highly susceptible to bleed damage; pay attention to her summons that spawns from the corners. they can shield her away from you, allowing her to spam her spells from afar. if you decide to fight her before using the carian inverted statue, you can force her to come down by riding up the elevator from the entrance site of grace. she will fall down the hole while trying to attack you. one of the most crucial points of interest in elden ring, the church of vows, allows you to revive fallen npcs that you have previously killed. when entering the church for the first time, you'll be greeted by miriel, pastor of vows —a giant tortoise who serves the sacred chamber as its steward. miriel is also a sorceries and incantation npc, able to receive the many different prayerbooks you obtain throughout your journey. in addition to that, miriel will teach you much lore associated with the lands between. the statue of lady rennala at the northern end of the church is where you're able to "atone" your sins—reviving any killed npcs and retracting their aggression. however, you'll need the celestial dew to do so. be sure to hit the site of grace at the front of the church to access this location whenever you need it. the uld palace ruins are part of the bigger mausoleum compound, located west of the liurnia's minor erdtree. several ancestors guard the area where the wandering mausoleums roam, especially by the shallow waters. if you explore left from the ruined labyrinth site of grace, be sure to pick up the spiralhorn shield from a corpse at the top of the small hill. be careful of falling off that cliff; there is a group of ancestors waiting to ambush you around the corner. head north from past the first mausoleum and hit the mausoleum compound site of grace between the twin statues. follow the sound of the bell, and you'll soon find the second wandering mausoleum. if you already had been to the east raya lucaria gate, the site of grace here should point in the direction of bellum church. while the bellum church site of grace merely functions to point you towards the dectus grand lift, it also is the pathway to the northeasternmost part of liurnia lakes. take the steps down, and you'll soon run into a nomadic merchant under a massive stone structure. following this path will lead you to the ravine-veiled village—an alternative entrance to the altus plateau if you do not have the completed dectus medallion. if you follow the direction of the bellum church site of grace and past the raya lucarian soldiers encampment, head right before the entrance of the dectus grand lift. go up the mountain pass, and soon enough, your madness meter should start going up—this is due to the frenzied commoners up above the tower. try to clear the frenzied rats fast enough and pay attention to the meter as not only will you take massive damage, you'll be stunned due to the madness for a brief moment. climb up the tower and kill the remaining enemies, and that should prevent your madness meter from going up. move south towards the stone-walled village once you're done with the frenzy-flaming tower. the enemies inside are all frenzied by madness, so try to take them down one group at a time to avoid getting cornered. be sure to loot up the shabriri's woes talisman from a corpse at the edge of the village and the frenzied's cookbook 1 from inside one of the houses. you can find the converted fringe tower on the northeasternmost part of liurnia, just above the entrance to the black knife catacombs . the easiest way to get here is to head east from the frenzied flame village outskirts site of grace. near the access to the tower, you'll find a troll knight in the middle of a field, defeat him to obtain the ash of war: giant hunt . head inside and read the message in front of the statue that "may erudition light way!" this message hints at the solution of the puzzle required to access the top of the tower. to remove the magic barrier, you'll need to perform the erudition gesture while wearing any glinstone crown headpiece, i.e., karolos glinstone crown, twinsage glinstone crown, etc. you can obtain the gesture from thops at the church of irith as a reward for giving him the second academy glinstone key. check out our detailed guide on the academy of raya lucaria to find the key. inside the tower, your path will be blocked by a giant orb of graven mages, who will emit magical attacks. dart around them or attack while strafing to get rid of the giant angry ball, then take the lift up to find a chest that holds two spells: the gavel of haima sorcery , and the cannon of haima sorcery . at the end of the bellum highway in the far northeast lies the grand lift of dectus, but before you can get to it, you'll need to get back a large blockade of raya lucaria soldiers, flanked by three catapults and lots of barricades. it can be hard to run straight into the camp, so you may want to try running along a high path along the right to jump down to the two catapults on the right. down here you'll be able to summon a spirit to help - which may be useful before long, as a raya lucarian knight on horseback guards the two catapult operators. just past the catapults on the east side are more tents with foot soldiers and a few raya lucarian soldiers, protecting a chest that holds a great mace . while you're here, you can also check behind the tent to find a cerulean teardrop scarab. moving into the central road in the blockade, be wary of a flame chariot flanked by yet another raya lucarian knight. have your spirit summon run interfernce and try to attack the flame chariot operator from behind as it rolls around, and use torrent to race circles around it when possible. on the far west side of the blockade is the last catapult, with a foot soldier sentry who can sound the alarm to alert the others - including one last raya lucarian knight not on horseback. search nearby to find a corpse with 3 cuckoo glintstone , and check the ledge below the cliff nearby to find a crimson teardrop scarab hiding on the wall of the ledge. just to the south is a series of giant tombstones on the cliff to allow you passage down, as well as a body with a rune arc to grab. moving north to the grand lift itself, you can find dragonwound grease on the steps to the lift - but you'll find that the lift is inoperable without the dectus medallion. in order to get it, you'll need to find its two fragments hidden away in forts in both east limgrave and dragonbarrow in northern caelid - see this guide to find their exact locations. before heading off, be sure to check the small woods just to the left of the lift to find scarab you can chase down to get a somber smithing stone 3 . as you explore this region, you may come across several scarabs scampering away. some of them will refill your flask of tears, but others can reward you with special items: reward: somber smithing stone 2 (x2) this scarab can be hard to spot, as its hiding just past the liurnia highway north pass that's full of soldiers battling, and the scarab is hiding off on the right behind some rocks near the cliff walls. reward: somber smithing stone 2 on the eastern edge of liurnia is the carian study hall built at the base of the divine tower of liurnia. as you approach the entrance from the lower path to the north, you can spot a scarab just outside the entrance. reward: ash of war - barbaric roar on the far north edge of the flooded lake is a long ravine leading under bellum highway towards the ruin-strewn precipice. right at the end where the large falls area, you can find a scarab hiding in the back, but it's surrounded by vampire bats. reward: somber smithing stone 3 to the far northeast on the other side of the bridge from raya lucaria is the bellum highway that leads to a grant lift up to altus plateau. if you look to the left and jump down from the stairway to the lift, you can find a small wooden area with a scarab and many vampire bats. reward: frenzied burst spell over to the east of the grand lift of dectus is a frenzied village guarded by a tower that inflicts madness - you'll need to sprint to it between bursts and defeat the enemy at the top, then explore through the walled village and exit out the north side, one of the lower hills at the top of the village has a scarab - but it's guarded by many frenzied creatures. /n north liurnia is one of the three areas that comprise the large region of liurnia of the lakes in elden ring. this page includes an overview of the area, including all main dungeons, bosses, loot, and secrets to find in this region. north liurnia is the large central area of the liurnia region, comprising of much of the flooded lake that has swallowed up many ruins, turning the land into a bog filled with nightmares, and even flooding the small academy gate town - with the giant academy of raya lucaria looming large above the entire lake in the center. this area is home to many secrets and all manner of creatures that traverse the bog, as well as many points of interest barely standing in the flooded waters, and includes the large second legacy dungeon in elden ring. to reveal the details and topography of the whole liurnia region, you'll need to find three map fragments at the steles located in east liurnia, north liurnia, and the west liurnia. you can find the north liurnia map fragment at the southern entrance to the academy gate town along the flooded main road leading into the town before you enter the ruins proper. liurnia's legacy dungeon is called the academy of raya lucaria , and it is the second such main dungeon you will encounter naturally in elden ring. it is somwhat close in size to stormveil castle , and looms over the entirety of the liurnia region from its high foundation above the gate town and flooded regions below. it is home not to a demigod, but to sharbearer nonetheless by the name of rennala, queen of the full moon . entering the dungeon will not be as straightforward as stormveil castle, as you will find the main bridge entrance beyond the gate town sealed by magical wards. luckily, a body by the entrance holds a map of the location of the academy glintstone key, guarded by a fearsome dragon just to the west of the academy itself. gaining this key will allow you to teleport from the seal directly to the entrance to the academy, where you can also use another seal to teleport across the crumbling bridge east to the bellum highway. as with stormveil castle, it's highly recommended you explore the rest of liurnia, level up, and gather up smithing stones to enhance your weapons before infiltrating the school of glintstone sorcerers and their constructs. when you're ready, see our academy of raya lucaria walkthrough to learn how to defeat the enemies within, and find every last item and secret inside. academy of raya lucaria bosses npcs red wolf of radagon none rennala, queen of the full moon

a strange-looking woman calling out for your assistance. she's lost her necklace to a blackguard living nearby and wants it back - how you get it back is up to you. if you help her out, she'll seem pleased, and meet you at the altus plateau after you take the grand lift of dectus up to the next region. blackguard big boggart - a minor npc that first serves as part of rya questline , he's a man who is obsessed with seafood, particularly prawns and crabs. doing the questline will allow him to become a merchant (if you don't kill him for his mask and fist weapons). boggart, if befriended, can

the mists. after being returned to your world, you can speak to him nearby to get an additional reward - a smithing stone 5, and learn more about his quest to defeat the bloody fingers and his greatest foe, eleonora. north liurnia is home to many interesting locations, enemy camps, and other points of interest that you can discover in your journeys. though they differ in the enemies and treasure found within, each place has something worth discovering. click on a point of interest to jump to the sections below that explain them in greater detail, including the enemies you'll face and secrets you can find. location enemies notable loot or npcs 1 scenic isle land octopus, deathbird (at night) rya, patches 2 boilprawn shack albinauracs big boggart the blackguard, dexterity-knot

shield, stonesword key 6 temple quarter albinaurics, miranda flowers icerind hatchet, ash of war - thops barrier (from teardrop scarab) 7 testu's rise skeletons memory stone 8 walking mausoleum mausoleum soldiers somber smithing stone 3 this tiny island northwest of laskyar ruins contains a site of grace that points you in the direction of academy gate town. in addition, you can find two npcs here—rya, just east of the island next to the birdseye telescope, and patches if he is forgiven during his boss fight in limgrave. academy gate town is the sunken remains of the former town where the academy's sorcerers lived. there are tons of albinaurics and miranda flowers roaming the area, as well as giant crabs. the site of grace of this area is also next to the north liurnia map stelle. you'll also find diallos here—mourning the loss of his servant, lanya, atop the roof of a sunken building. if you head west of his location, there is a glinstone craftsman's cookbook 4 inside a chest on a tower. head further west, and you'll soon find a golden seed near some ruins. these ruins of a former church now plagued by scarlet rot and overgrown bloodroses lie southwest of the academy's southern entrance. you'll find white-mask varre standing outside, prompting you to join his order with the bloody lord. inside the church, you'll find an assassin that will spawn from the ground if you get too close to the center. this church is also a great place to harvest bloodrose for crafting. there is a small island to the church's northwest where you can grab the bloodflame blade incantation from a scarab. the boilprawn shack is the residence of blackguard big boggart, an important npc if you're doing rya questline —you won't be able to interact with boggart outside of this questline. there is also a site of grace on the western side of the building, next to big boggart. south raya lucaria gate is the only part of the former academy town that is not underwater. you'll find many raya lucarian guards here, as well as a monk chariot that drops a smithing stone 3. clearing the enemies shouldn't be difficult, but we recommend going past them and hitting the site of grace just outside the magic barrier before looting the surrounding area. if you go below the gate (under the academy), head north, and you'll find a stonesword key on a corpse sitting on a chair. just a short distance away from the rose church lies more ruins, this time belonging to a former temple. now home to albnaurics and miranda flowers, the temple quarter is excellent to farm bloodrose. loot the chest atop one of the towers—you'll find the icerind hatchet , a dexterity-based axe. be sure to hit the nearby temple quarter site of grace since this is the closest checkpoint before facing glinstone dragon smarag . similar to oridys's rise in the weeping peninsula (south limgrave) , a magic barrier also blocks this lookout tower in the northern part of the lake. while this is the case initially, unlocking the barrier requires you to seek out "three wise beasts" somewhere on the island. these beasts are like those in oridys's rise, represented by spectral tortoises. kill all the tortoises (and take out any spectral skeletons hounding you), and you'll be allowed access into the tower, where you'll find a memory stone as your reward. one of the few walking mausoleums in liurnia is located in the waters below the east raya lucaria gate site of grace, east of the broken bridge. unlike other mausoleums, the skull deposits usually on its legs are located near the mausoleum's entrance. to get to the top of the mausoleum while it's still walking, use the nearby spiritspring jump and wait for it to get close. you'll need to time your double jump just right; otherwise, you'll miss the narrow area where you can land. once there, just hit a few of those deposits, and the mausoleum should fall to the ground. as you explore this region, you may come across several scarabs scampering away. some of them will refill your flask of tears, but others can reward you with special items: reward: bloodflame blade spell on the southwestern side of the lakes below the academy of raya lucaria is a large ruined rose church where white-mask varre can be found. on the north side of the church in the water, look for a scarab idling about. reward: ash of war - thops' barrier to the northwest of the temple quarter ruins in the middle of the liurnia lake is a small island hill where a scarab presides. it can and will teleport around the island as you draw close, so you'll either need to charge or snipe from a distance to take it down. reward: ash of war - charge forth this tricky scarab is hiding where you'd least expect: on the underside of a small bridge on the west side of the south raya lucaria gate just past the ruined gate town. it's below where you can find a withered maiden and there's a large crab patrolling nearby. shoot it down from under the bridge with a bow or spell, or even a throwing knife. reward: ash of war - shield bash you can find this scarab underneath the large broken bridge leading from raya lucaria towards bellum highway, next to a site of grace. search between the bridge pillars to find the scarab hidden away. reward: ash of war - spectral lance this scarab is located within the legacy dungeon known as the academy of raya lucaria. early on you'll need to traverse through a large graveyard area, and when you finally reach the exit, you can head past it on the left to find a path circling back down to find a scarab. as expected, there are a plethora of secrets for you to uncover across the region in elden ring ranging from imp statue doors to teleporters, mimics, and hidden items. here you’ll find all of the secrets found so far in the west limgrave area. while you can run into a lot of the dangerous giant crayfish when exploring liurnia, one of them is more than meets the eye. located southeast of the rose church just before a group of three crayfish is a solitary patrolling one. when killed, it will vanish in a puff of smoke to reveal its true form as a grafted scion - the same enemy you fought at the start of the game. defeat this terrible foe and you'll be awarded a larval tear to be used for respeccing your character after you clear the academy of raya lucaria all across north liurnia are various small gazebo-like enclosed stone shrines - many of which house a small statue of a woman. you can find something of interest at each of these shrines - including lots of smithing stones: next to birds-eye telescope - rya west of highway lookout tower - 3x smithing stone 2 (guarded by many land squirts west of boilprawn shack - 3x smithing stone 2 (guarded by 3 giant crayfish) west of gate town bridge - 3x smithing stone 3 (guarded by 2 giant crayfish) south of rose church - folly on the lake site of grace east of minor erdtree - 3x smithing stone 2 (guarded by 2 giant octopus) western crystalline woods - 3x smithing stone 3 (guarded by 2 mounted revenants) south of testu’s rise - 3x smithing stone 2 (guarded by 3 giant crayfish) east of gate town north - sending gate to west liurnia map stele west of eastern liurnia lakeshore - 3x smithing stone 3 (guarded by blighted bloom flower)/n west liurnia is one of the three areas that comprise the large region of liurnia of the lakes in elden ring. this page includes an overview of the area, including all main dungeons, bosses, loot, and secrets to find in this region. west liurnia is the expansive highlands and mountain areas of the liurnia region, including the decimated albinauric village hiding in the shadow of the large mountaintop known as the moonlight altar (which can only be accessed later in the game), and also includes the mysterious and well-defended caria manor to the north. this area is home to many secrets and all manner of creatures - including soldier patrols, enemy camps, and even poisonous bogs. to reveal the details and topography of the whole liurnia region, you'll need to find three map fragments at the steles located in east liurnia, north liurnia, and the west liurnia. you can find the west liurnia map fragment near the far northwestern tip - far north of the academy of raya lucaria and testu's rise, on a small road above the waterline just before the kingsrealm ruins, on the path towards caria manor. west liurnia is home to several world bosses that can be found outside of dungeons, some of which roam in certain areas, and others that are hiding until you draw close enough to trigger their arrival. there are also several scripted invasions by npc humans that will force you into a conflict. click on a boss below to learn more about how to defeat them. boss name location

will perish as soon as he gives you the haligtree secret medallion (right). nepheli loux - the adopted daughter of gideon ofnir, you can find nepheli under the stone bridge leading up to the village of albinaurics after exhausting her dialogue at the roundtable hold. she'll help you defeat the village's roaming boss, omenkiller. war counselor iji - war counselor iji is one of ranni's advisors and a lifelong smith to the carian manor royal family. outside of blaidd in east limgrave , iji is the first npc you'll encounter in liurnia that connects you to ranni the witch questline . he also sells upgrading materials. if you helped blaidd defeat the bloodhound knight at the limgrave evergaol, he'll have told you to speak with iji, who will then add a talisman to his wares in addition to somber smithing stones. war counselor iji's wares somber smithing stone 1 (2000 runes) somber smithing stone 2 (3000 runes) somber smithing stone 3 x3 (4000 runes) somber smithing stone 4 x3 (6000 runes)

subregion of three sisters, in liurnia lakes. completing her quest will allow you to choose the "age of stars," ending at the end of the game. check our in-depth guide on ranni the witch questline to learn more. seluvis - a sorcerer and part of ranni's counsel, selivus resides in the southernmost tower in the three sisters. seluvis questline overlaps with ranni's, and depending on your actions, it will lead to different endings of both questlines. he also has a few mid to high-level sorceries available for purchase. he also has a secret cellar full of creepy "puppets", and if you call him out on this, he may offer to sell you some puppets as spirit summons in exchange for starlight shards. seluvis's wares carian phalanx (12000 runes) carian retaliation (9000 runes) glinstone icecrag (7500

chelona's rise alpha wolves, crystal snails ranni's dark moon spell you can find this former village by exploring the swamp to the west of liurnia. go west of the scenic isle site of grace until you reach the southern landmass of the region; there should be a few giant crabs roaming the vicinity. head up the slope to the left, the village of albinaurics is located under the plateau. keep going up until you find the village's site of grace, located near an abandoned shack by the well with the spectral npc. head up the nearby slope. there will be a permufer at the top; dispose of him and continue until you reach a stone coffin. next to that coffin is a large clay pot that, when attacked, will reveal albus. albus is a one-time npc that will give the haligtree secret medallion (right), one part of a crucial key item that grants access to a secret path to the consecrated snowfield . once you finished talking to albus, make your way to the nearby stone bridge. there will be albinaurics on the bridge that's easy to kill. keep moving forward and pause at the end of the bridge to use your summoning ashes. next to the bonfire ahead is a field boss, the omenkiller—he drops the crucible knot talisman when killed. the converted tower is one of the first locations you'll come across on the western landmass of liurnia. climb up the broken ruins of the tower directly to the right of the site of grace. you can run and jump or use torrent to get to its roof—climb up the stairs and grab the memory stone inside the chest. this heavily-guarded caravan is swarming with raya lucarian soldiers, attack dogs, noble sorcerers, and more. they start from the enemy camp just below the four belfries. we recommend waiting until the caravan stops moving at the nearby coast, as the enemies will disperse into multiple groups at that point. sneak up behind the trolls and loot the carian knight's sword inside the chest. the four belfries is a unique point of interest with three waygates that teleport you to different locations in the lands between. you'll need one imbued stonesword key to unlock each waygate. starting from the top, we'll break down where these waygates will take you. if you're looking for more imbued keys to travel to through these locked sending gates, you can find a second imbued sword key inside the legacy dungeon of the academy of raya lucaria - on the low rooftops leading off to the top of the church of the cuckoo. the third imbued sword key can be found all the way in caelid - at sellia, town of sorcery - inside a chest that can be unsealed by lighting one of the towers. if you keep moving north on the main road from where you'd find the enemy caravan, you'll soon come across the northern liurnia lake shore site of grace. pick up the map (liurnia, west) just north of here. there are several noble sorcerers here that can go invisible. there is an illusory floor that you can reveal by rolling on top of it to the northeast; this will lead you to an underground boss room. the royal revenant is a relatively easy fight if you summon a spirit to direct his attention for his rapid charging attacks, though his moveset and ability to go invisible can be a nuisance. defeat him, open the door to the back, and grab the frozen needle thrusting sword from the chest. you'll find war counselor iji—a smith and an essential npc in ranni the witch questline to the north of the ruins. he will point you in the direction of caria manor, a major dungeon to the very north of liurnia. you may have been told about iji from blaidd back in limgrave, if you tell iji that blaidd sent you, he'll add a talisman to his wares for you to buy - otherwise, you can use him to buy an abundance of somber smithing stones or upgrade your armaments at his smithing table. aptly named for the three towers to the west of caria manor, the three sisters are points of interest associated with ranni the witch and her counsels. you'll find her at the top of ranni's rise. be wary of the glinstone dragon adula near the entrance to her tower; the dragon will move south to the cathedral of manus celes when brought down to 50% hp. seluvis is located in his tower at the south—check out our detailed guide on seluvis questline to learn more. be sure to loot the black wolf mask on the broken wall behind seluvis's rise. renna's rise in the north is inaccessible until a certain point in renna the witch questline . a chest contains the snow witch set on the tower's second floor. the waygate at the very top will relocate you to a section of the ainsel river . you can find this large cemetery behind the caria manor —head outside from the royal moongazing grounds site of grace and turn right. go down the path and kill the teardrop scarab that drops the frozen armament sorcery. keep moving down the same direction until you reach the behind caria manor site of grace. head northeast from the site of grace, a ghost sits on a chair behind a large stone. he'll drop the juvenile scholar cap, juvenile scholar robe, and a larval tear as a reward for completing the "resurrection" painting from east liurnia 's artist's shack. the moonlight altar is the plateau above the village of albinaurics. you can only get to this area once you've defeated astel, naturalborn of the void in the grand cloister—accessible from the lake of rot past the underground region of nokstella, eternal city. the moonlight altar encompasses a large area of west liurnia, and is home to many extremely dangerous enemies and optional rewards and content in all directions. just to the north of the ainsel deep well access, you can come across not one, but three unnamed glintstone dragons all resting near each other. they aren't technically bosses, but they are formidable - especially if you accidentally wake them all up at once, so you'll need to be careful in attacking them to try taking them on one at a time and avoid getting close to bring in others. each of them will drop a dragon heart for a total of 3. moving up the hill from the moonlight altar site of grace, you'll soon come across glinstone dragon adula once more. while it's unnecessary to defeat him to go inside the cathedral of manus celes, he drops a dragon heart and the adula's moonblade sorcery upon defeat - and unlocks a unique spell back at the dragon communion altar. the cathedral of manus celes is a great place to pick up several starlight shards. go under the cathedral through the broken floor to the right of the altar until you reach ranni—this is the last part of her questline, rewarding you with the legendary dark moon greatsword . around the cathedral to the north is the moonfolk ruins, where among some vanishing noble undead you can find a illusory floor revealing a cellar down to a somber smithing stone 8. to the south of the cathedral is the lunar estate ruins, where royal revenants can spawn to ambush and deal massive damage - but luckily you can summon a spirit in this area to fight back with. if you search the western estate ruins, look for another illusory stone floor revealing another cellar entrance with its own imp seal, requiring a stonesword key to reach a chest with a cerulean amber talisman +2. to the far northwest you'll find a path down to the ringleader's evergaol where a very tough black knife assassin boss can be fought, and to the south of it is a small ridge with three stone shrines guarded by a red wolf of radagon. defeat it, and you can help yourself to the abundance of smithing stones in the shrines, 6 smithing stone 7s, and 3 smithing stone 8s! finally, the road down to the southwest corner is guarded by non-boss crystalians, leading to chelona's rise and a forested road full of crystal slugs and alpha wolves. chelona's rise is located in the far southwest of the moonlight altar, a small wizard tower with it's own riddle to solve that can be hard to figure out unless you know where to look. like other wizard towers, there's a imp statue holding a message that activates the riddle: seek the three wise beasts. once you interact with the note, you need to find three large spectral turtles all across the moonlight altar plateau. one all turtles have been eliminated, return to chelona's rise to ascend to the top to get your reward - the legendary spell known as ranni's dark moon. as you explore this region, you may come across several scarabs scampering away. some of them will refill your flask of tears, but others can reward you with special items: reward: ash of war - vow of the indomitable on the far west side of liurnia is a giant hollowed out mountain with a darkened village and poison swamps below. search the poison swamp area on the south side to find a scarab and ride in on horseback to claim it - while watchin for giant crab ambushes. reward: somber smithing stone 2 on the northern edge of the poison swamp near the village of the albinaurics, you can find a series of ledges and platforms overlooking some woods and the converted tower to the north. check around the larger peaks and ledges here to find a scarab on the edge. reward: ash of war - sword dance on the northwest edge of liurnia near the minor erdtree lies a path down to a mini dungeon along the cliffs. the passage will take you on a narrow road, and you can find a scarab along the way. reward: ash of war - chilling mist spell once you've completed caria manor to the northeast, you can exit out the door to find the group of towers known as the three sisters. a scarab lurks among the ruins here that you can hunt down. reward: frozen armament spell opposite the path to the three sisters above caria manor is a long path around the manor towards a large cemetery, where many wolves and a few vanishing mages wander. look along the main path for a scarab to attack. as expected, there are a plethora of secrets for you to uncover across the region in elden ring ranging from imp statue doors to teleporters, mimics, and hidden items. here you’ll find all of the secrets found so far in the north liurnia area. after you've met with ranni the witch and her creepy advisor seluvis, check around the ruins outside of ranni's tower for a large stone floor you can attack to reveal an illusory floor leading to a secret basement. inside are dozens of immobile characters - "puppets" as seluvis calls them, including a secret illusory wall at the back leading to a replica of sorceress sellen's room at the waypoint ruins. if you inspect the message left behind by seluvis and confront him on it, he'll get mad - but then relent and offer to sell you puppets to be used as spirit summons in battle. depending on your choices with his proposition to drug nepheli, you'll be able to choose from 2-3 puppets and buy the others with starlight shards. see seluvis' questline for more information on his other propositions. /n academy of raya lucaria is the second legacy dungeon you can encounter in elden ring, and contains many challenges and dangers, as well as a demigod boss. this page will contain walkthrough and guide information on how to reach the academy, all the treasures and items that can be found inside, tips for navigating the dungeon, and how to defeat its fearsome bosses. how to get to academy of raya lucaria finding the academy glintstone key academy of raya lucaria walkthrough church of the cuckoo schoolhouse classroom red wolf of radagon boss fight debate parlor rennala, queen of the full moon boss fight video guide - getting the glintstone key you will be able to see the academy of raya lucaria in the distance immediately upon stepping out of the stormveil castle backdoor and into liurnia of the lakes, but finding the academy and getting into the academy are two different tasks. our first goal should be to get the area map. follow the path to the left of the lake-facing cliffs site of grace, past the church, graveyard, and carian soldier's camp and you will eventually reach a merchant and a new site of grace at the lake level. from here the path becomes harder to follow, but thankfully the map is incredibly close, barely north of this site of grace. simply follow the broken pieces of wall and blue lanterns north and you will come across the map, but be careful of the small army of mage enemies waiting in the shadows around the path. with the map unlocked you can head north and battle your way through the academy gate town and reach the dungeon entrance, but there is a quicker way. follow the path a little farther past the map marker to find the laskyar ruins site of grace. from here go directly east and you will stumble upon the purified ruins. explore the ruins until you come across a teleporter in one of the crumbling buildings. use the teleporter and it will take you directly to the front gate where you can activate the south raya lucaria gate site of grace. as i mentioned before, getting into the academy is an entirely different story from getting into stormveil. walk up to the magic barrier and it will deny you access. loot the body next to the gate to get the meeting place map, which offers a hint about where you can find the academy glintstone key that will allow you to get in. check the hint against your world map and you can see that the meeting place is a small island on the west side of the academy. set a marker and ride your horse around to reach the spot, but be careful! this island is guarded by a powerful glintstone dragon . either go into stealth to sneak in and grab the academy glintstone key , or charge in on horseback and dash out as soon as you loot it. either way don't stick around to feel the dragon's wrath. video guide - entering the academy of raya lucaria return to the south raya lucaria gate site of grace and examine the seal to enter the dungeon. immediately inside is another site of grace you can activate, then go left and take the elevator up and into the academy proper. from the top of the elevator go forward through the garden ahead of you. take the stairs down on your right to find a magic grease then get back on the path forward up the tall staircase that is guarded by two masked magicians. take them out and open the door to reach a large open chapel. you will see another mage at the front of the room, but as soon as you start to approach some marionette soldiers will ambush you from above. be careful when dealing with these enemies! after taking some damage they begin to malfunction and swing their weapons wildly, making it nearly impossible to get a hit in. simply back off and wait for them to topple over before attacking again. wtih the enemies dead you can loot the somber smithing stone [3] in the back of the chapel, and the golden rune [2] in an alcove to the right of the pedestal. additionally, there is an illusory wall in this room you can access right now. from the front door, go right and strike the wall where it connects to the corner. this will reveal a small area where you can find a rune arc . exit the chapel via the door on the left and you will find a hallway with another site of grace where you can rest and prepare to take on the real meat of the dungeon. from here run to the opposite end of the hallway where you will find a door leading to a graveyard outside. this area is swarming with shambling zombies that can grab you and drain your fp, so be careful when you see them preparing to lunge. start by going immediately right from the door. look over the edge and you will see a secret cliff below with an item on it. drop down to grab the smithing stone [4]. walk along the ledge and it will take you back to the main path. return to the door, but this time go left and walk along the higher ridge to reach a grace mimic on a body next to a large grave. glance over the ledge and you can see another item below, just be warned that it is surrounded by zombies. drop down and kill them all so you can loot the item, a spellproof dried liver . check behind these graves and you will find a hidden path that leads down. follow it and you will reach a gap you can jump across, leading you up to a secret cave occupied by two marionette archers. kill them and you can grab the marionette soldier ashes they were guarding. below are some more enemies lying in wait, including some zombies and a dog. i would recommend focusing the dog first, then looting the silver-pickled fowl foot he was guarding. when the enemies are all dead start heading up the hill, but keep your eye on the left side of the path where you will see some graves that are tipped over, creating a ramp. jump over them to find another secret path, and a golden rune [4]. walk up the path and you will encounter some more dogs, but also an ash scarab. watch out for the dogs attacks as you chase down the scarab, kill it to get the ash of war: spectral lance . follow this path to the end to reach a new door that is guarded by some more dogs and giant zombies. kill them all, then grab the magic grease x2 to the right of the door and the mushroom x5 behind some graves on the left. before we can go through the door we need to go find one last secret path with a very important item. go backwards down the path and keep your eye out for a large grave with a torch in front of it. look behind this grave and you will see a ledge below with an item on it that is guarded by some zombies. drop down and kill the zombies to claim the item, which is the complete carian knight set . if you have the endurance to wear it this set will offer better magic protection that most other armor you have at this point. with the armor in hand go left of the grave to find a path leading upwards. go to the very end where you can drop down to get a golden rune [4], then go through the thin cave nearby which will take you back to the graveyard. from here we can return to the door from earlier and pass through it where we will find the lift, as well as another small graveyard. go into the graveyard before taking the lift. here you will encounter a powerful alabaster lord who uses gravity spells along with a sword. thankfully he is also very slow moving and heavily telegraphs all of his attacks. the usual strategy of guard countering works wonder, but i would recommend backing off anytime he starts charging up his gravity magic because it can easily guard break. defeat him to claim the gravity well spell, as well as the somber smithing stone [3] on the grave he was guarding. now we can return to the lift and jump onto it. ride it all the way to the top where you will see a new area you can jump to. on the right is a building with a new site of grace, and on the left are some caves with enemies inside. explore the caves to find crystal dart x5 and a golden rune [4]. with those items in hand head to the site of grace and rest before moving on. if you do decide to go to the bottom of the lift at this point you will find yourself in a shallow pool of water with the abductor. kill or avoid the abductor and you can find a few items here: longtail cat talisman , smithing stone [5], and lost ashes of war . video guide - the schoolhouse classroom take the stairs out of the schoolhouse classroom, looking out for the mage warrior who is patrolling the connected hallway. when the coast is clear go to the left and find the conspectus scroll on the body in the small room here. open the door next to the scroll and step out onto the balcony where you can grab a smithing stone [4]. but that's not all! look over the edge of the balcony and you will see a ledge below you can drop to. follow this ledge around the corner where you will find a small grassy area. climb the rocks piled up in the corner to reach a hidden path that leads back to the lift. be careful not to fall down any of the gaps in the path, then grab the olvinus glintstone crown at the end before dropping down and heading back to the site of grace room. go back into the hallway and follow it down the opposite direction, where you will encounter two more mages, followed by a room full of mages and a large jar warrior. you will want to draw the jar warrior away from the mages or else risk being stunlocked by their barrage of spells. avoid the jars heavy slam attacks and strike him when he is standing back up. then carefully reenter the room with the mages, picking them off one by one until the room is clear, allowing you to loot the nearby chest and get the ritual pot . we will get to the locked door in a minute, for now go up the stairs and into the large chamber above. stealthily backstab the mage ahead of the stairs, but beware the other mages lurking behind as they will immediately start pelting you with spells when you reveal yourself. hide behind the pillars to protect yourself from the spells, then rush in when you see an opening to attack the mages. once the room is clear you can grab the furlcalling finger remedy from the balcony, then head up the stairs where you will see a boss room waiting at the end of the hall. but first, about that locked door. in the room that connects to the boss hallway there are four bookcases, one of which doesn't have any books on it. strike this one to reveal a hidden passage to another room which contains a chest with the comet spell and a stonesword key . take the ladder in the corner up to the rafters then head toward the front of the room. here you can see there is a false wall you can drop down behind. inside the false wall is a small hallway with a chute you can drop down into yet another secret room. here you can grab the graven school talisman from the large pile of crystals, then open the locked door from earlier and get back to the jar warrior hallway. go back to the site of grace if you need to rest (remember the enemies will respawn) then prepare to take on the boss room we saw earlier. red wolf of radagon might just be the toughest enemy yet. similar to the lion we faced in stormveil keep the red wolf is both quick and powerful, but he takes things up a notch by mixing projectiles in with his barrage of attacks. his bite and claw attacks are quick and usually part of multi-hit combos, so do not attempt to punish these unless you are absolutely certain it is the final attack. the red wolf can also summon a magic sword that it swings with its mouth. thankfully these attacks are much easier to see coming and easier to punish than his basic attacks. block the swings or dodge inward as he slahes and you should be able to hit back with 2-3 attacks or a guard counter. any time he backs off he will likely summon 1-3 homing spells which hang in the air for a moment before flying toward you. it is best to just back off anytime there are in play, as you don't want to risk getting struck by the wolf and his spells at the same time. follow these instructions and you should be able to wear him down and defeat him, claiming his memory stone and a new site of grace as your prize. video guide - past the debate parlor debate parlor is the starting point for the most item dense sections of the academy, so get ready for the long haul! exit the parlor using the door in the back left corner which opens up to a large courtyard. as soon as you step out of the gate take a right and walk over to the ledge and peek around the corner to see a secret path leading to a ladder. jump down onto the ledge and take the ladder up to get on top of the debate parlor. climb inside through the shattered window. explore the rafters to find a crystal bud and a chest containing the radagon icon . exit via the doorway near the chest and you will end up on a balcony overlooking the courtyard with two mages enemies on it. peek over the right side ledge of the balcony and you will see a mage and some jar warriors guarding an item. drop down and kill all of the enemies to claim the cracked pot and living jar shard they were guarding. exit using the stairs to get back down to the courtyard, then immediately climb up the pile of rubble ahead of you to reach another platform, this one absolutely teeming with enemies. immediately turn your attention to the two mages looking down on you from the upper level. they will start raining spells on you as soon as you step into their view, so ignore all the other enemies and rush up the next set of stairs so you can deal with them immediately. there is a third mage in the small room underneath the staircase, so turn your focus to him as soon as you've killed the two. take care of all the weaker enemies crowding around, then check inside the room to find the glintstone whetblade . finally, ascend the staircase across from the small room where you will deal with one last mage and find a golden rune [2]. return to the highest level where you dealt with the two mages and you will find a locked door. look over the balcony to the left of the door and you will see a platform you can drop down to. there will be one mage ahead of you and one behind you, so be careful not to get trapped between their spell barrages. once they are dead descend the stairs and unlock the door that leads back to the courtyard. from the door, run to the fountain in the middle of the courtyard where you can grab a stonesword key . from here you can watch the abductor. if it notices you it will approach the fountain and attempt to attack. what you should do instead is go back through the door you just opened and go all the way up the stairs to the balcony at the top where you will find a dead end and a golden rune [3]. look down and you will see a roof you can drop to. look down from the roof and you will see a grassy ledge below with a strange looking crystal crab. drop down and kill the crab to get a karolos glintstone crown . follow this ledge around and you will see a golden tree with another golden seed you can loot. the abductor should ignore you while you are over here, so run back to the open door and jump back onto that roof from before. this time we are going to run along the roof towards the bell tower in the distance. here you will encounter two marionette soldiers. their malfunctions are extra dangerous on the limited space of the rooftop, so approach them with care and don't be afraid to back off if you need to. before you go up the ladder check the ledge to the left of it where you will find a golden rune [4]. at the top of the ladder is a rooftop path that leads directly to the bell tower, but beware: there is a mage waiting at the end of the path and three flying marionette soldiers waiting to ambush you. approach slowly and you can draw them out and deal with them one by one instead of getting swarmed by four enemies at once. grab the crystal dart x5 along the path, then check around the backside of the bell tower to find meteor bolt x5. from here we need to do some careful jumping and dropping to progress. around the back side of the bell tower you will see a roof just below you can drop to, and then from there you can drop one more to another short section of roof. look to the left and you will see a large gap between the roof you are on and an adjacent roof lower down. you need to execute a very precise running jump to clear this gap, and it also seems to help if you jump from the highest point of the higher roof toward the lower point of the lower roof. it may take a few attempts so be careful if you are carrying a lot of runes. once on the other side look to the left where you will see a series of descending roofs guarded by various marionette soldiers. make your way all the way down this path and you will find the opening into the bell tower at the very bottom. be careful when you step inside because there are two more marionette soldiers waiting to ambush you. once they are dead you can climb the ladder all the way up to the top of the tower where there is a chest containing the full moon crossbow . from here you will want to jump off of the western edge of the bell tower and land on the roof below. from here you can drop down one more roof to find a body with a smithing stone [4]. next, execute a running jump off the left side of this roof to land on the same adjacent roof we made that difficult jump to earlier. this time go forward and carefully jump across the rooftops until you reach another tower with a cracked open wooden floor. drop through the floor and keep dropping until you reach the platform with another crystal crab who will drop the lazuli glintstone crown . keep dropping until you reach the bottom where you will find some crabs guarding a somber smithing stone [4]. step outside this room and ascend the nearby ladder to get a higher vantage point. from the top of the ladder you can cross a thin section of roof to a yet another small tower with an item inside, an imbued sword key . there is another tower directly next to this one you can jump to to find a smithing stone [3]. return to the ladder and you will see another large building you can jump to from this ledge. this is the top of the church of the cuckoo. there are two marionette soldiers patrolling this roof, so make sure you clear them out before you walk around. if you walk along the left side of the roof you will also get ambushed by two flying marionette soldiers, so be careful of their attacks. there is also a magic grease x2 on one of the connected rooftops nearby. climb through the window and you will find yourself on the rafters above the church. carefully navigate your way to the body hanging on the rafters to loot a golden rune [3]. drop down to the next set of rafters, then look for the chandelier that has an item on it. carefully drop to the chandelier to get the second academy glintstone key . there should be a walkway directly underneath you, patrolled by some more academy mages. drop down and defeat all of them, then find and kick the ladder to create a shortcut to the church of cuckoo below. explore the walkway and you should find a body holding the shattering crystal spell. look for a door that leads to the outdoor balcony where you can find yet another crystal crab, this one dropping the twinsage glintstone crown . go back onto the walkway above the church and look for the other exit that leads to a long hallway guarded by a crossbow wielding perfumer. avoid his exploding bolts and get close to him for an attack. guard counters are effective, but he jumps around a lot so try to pin him against a wall where he cannot escape. once he is defeated go to the other end of the hall to find a small crystal filled room where you can grab azur's glintstone staff . through all of this we only missed one item a golden rune [3] that was on a rooftop guarded by marionette soldiers below the difficult roof gap jump. if you want to do another round of jumping you can go grab it, but otherwise you've got all the major items! with our jumping quest completed we are ready to head for the boss room. go back to the courtyard and walk toward the right side ledge, closest to the large staircase floating nearby. use the thin walkways to cross over to the stairs, but be careful walking on them. when you try to climb up a large iron ball will come rolling down. pay attention to the way it bounces between the railings and try to squeeze in the small openings around the edges. head through the door at the top and down the hall into the courtyard on the other side. here you will encounter a powerful carian knight. he is a formidable foe on both offense and defense. attempt to attack him blindly and he will parry you with ease, but if you simply try to block he will break through your guard with relentless swings. however the good news is you can just as easily turn his overzealous swings back on him by parrying his attacks and serving him a taste of his own medicine. if you are lucky he may put his shield away in favor of his staff which creates an opening to go after him while he can't defend. just be extra careful of the powerful magic spells he can dish out during this time. try and pin him into a corner and lock him down with attacks until he is defeated. your reward is his carian knight's shield . from here you can go forward and up the elevator to the boss, but there is one more area we need to see. so instead go out the left side into the garden area where there are some weak enemies tending to the plants, one mage hiding in the corner, and a golden rune [4]. keep going down this path and you will enter a long hallway that leads to that locked doorway above the courtyard from long ago. open it up and head back to the garden. head back to the spot where you grabbed the golden rune and you will see a thin ledge that connects this garden to the adjacent room. use the ledge to get inside and open the locked door from within. go back into the room and climb up the ladder where you will encounter another mage as well as one of the pumpkin helmed warriors. loot the chest in this room to get the glintstone scarab , then jump off the balcony near the chest to land on an awning above the portal where you can find a golden rune [7]. defeating the enemies here will also stop the rolling boulders, meaning you can go down and loot the smithing stone [5], furlcalling finger remedy , and crystal darts on the staircase below. with that last bit of business complete, we are ready to head up the elevator to the boss of raya lucaria. rennala, queen of the full moon , is the second elden lord most players are likely to encounter. she is a powerful sorceress who oversees the academy of raya lucaria and is a rather tough elden ring boss to face. this battle has two phases, the first of which is more of a puzzle than a battle. rennala will float around overhead while her minions crawl around on the ground, pelting you with flying books and fire breath. you need to look around the room and identify which of her minions is singing, then go and attack that minion to end their song, which causes another to start up. after striking three of the minions rennala's protective shell will shatter and she will fall to the ground, allowing you to get in some attacks before she rises back into the air. she will trigger a magical explosion before she rises again, so be sure to back up when you see her building her spell. repeat this process until you deplete her health bar, triggering phase two. in phase two, rennala will face you directly with her full arsenal of spells. this includes: a magic laser she telegraphs by summons a large magic orb, which then shrinks into her hand before firing directly at you. this can be dodged by rolling left or right just before she fires. a barrage of homing crystals that acts sort of like a magic shotgun. you can tell this is coming if the tip of her staff gets spiky. as long as you aren't directly in front of these you can simply side step them as they chase you. a barrage of slower moving homing missiles, usually summoned when she dodges away from your attacks. just like the homing crystals these can be easily avoided by just side stepping or rolling into them before impact. a powerful magic bolt. she slightly floats off the ground just before letting this one loose. you can avoid this by simply dodging toward her as the spell comes towards you. a magic boomerang of sorts, this one flies toward you and spins around you for a few seconds, hitting multiple times and wearing down your endurance before flying back to her. her signature attack, she floats into the air and encases herself in a small moon before falling back to the ground. the moon then descends and makes impact with the ground, causing a massive explosion. the best action when you see this coming is just to run away. as you can see, the basic strategy here is to never stop moving. you constantly want to be strafing around her in the midrange, giving you time to react to her spells and charge in when an opening presents itself. the most punishable of these spells are the magic laser and the magic bolt, so keep an eye out for those above all. when she reaches about half health she will begin summoning various ash spirits to help her battle. these make things even more complicated when it comes to dodging, so your best bet is to just run away for the 15-30 seconds that the spirit persists for, then run in and attack her in the downtime between them. she can summon a troll, a dragon, an bloodhound knight, and wolves. her summon animation has a long cooldown, so if you are in position use the opportunity to land 2-3 strikes. your reward for defeating her is the remembrance of the full moon queen , and the great rune of the unborn . after the battle you will be returned to the original boss chamber where you can speak with rennala to change your appearance, and respec your character if you have a larval tear . /n ainsel river is a larger dungeon found in the liurnia region in elden ring. it is an optional underground area slightly more linear than the overworld, but keeps many of its core mechanics - including fast travel and the restoration of flasks upon defeating enemy groups persist whilst underground (however, unlike siofra river you cannot use torrent in this region). this page contains information on the location, walkthrough, and guide to traverse this area, locate all of its treasure, and tips to defeat the enemies within. looking for a particular section of this page? click one of the links below to jump to... how to get to ainsel river ainsel river walkthrough boss fight - dragonkin soldier of nokstella continuing to explore enemies boss notable loot giant ants, clayman, malformed star dragonkin soldier of nokstella rune arc , frozen lightning spear in eastern liurnia, just north of the eastern tableland site of grace, you'll arrive at a spherical domed building guarded by a golem. after dealing with the golem, most efficiently by targeting its ankles, open the door and step onto the lift to ride it down. just to the right as you step off the lift is the ainsel river well depths site of grace. heading down the slope from the site of grace, you'll note 5 giant ants lining the ceiling around a tunnel on the left-hand side. first, head right upstream through a small tunnel to loot a corpse containing magic grease . as you head back down, there is a giant ant on the ceiling which, whilst it doesn't always drop down, can do so and ambush you so be wary as you're passing by. dealing with the 5 giant ants (which you can lure down one by one if you're careful), head through the passageway that they were guarding and grab the grace mimic on the corpse lead over the coffin in the center of the stream. continuing on you'll be ambushed by an ant to the right tucked in an alcove, and there will be a patrolling ant roaming the lit tunnel to the south. dealing with the patrolling ant, another ant will sprint down the tunnel to the southeast, and upon defeating it you can either follow that tunnel to the southeast or go down the slope to the southwest. moving down the southeast tunnel, as you turn the corner you'll find a corpse holding a smithing stone (3) , as well as an ant that will ambush you from the far end, as well as one coming up from behind you. backtracking and heading down the southwest slope, two ants will drop from the ceiling. in the room beyond full of corpses and viscera, there will be two corpses; one with a silver firefly , one with a golden rune (1) . there is also a corpse in the tunnel to the left holding a golden rune, protected by an ant. you can platform up the rocks beyond to pass down a tunnel that opens out into a cave with multiple giant ants lining the ceiling, and an ant queen on the floor to the left. these are all non-hostile unless you attack the queen, so do so at your own peril. as such, if you wish, you can pass by without issue and after passing through the long tunnel you'll emerge above the uhl palace ruins. before dropping down, backtrack all the way to the room full of bones and viscera, and take the other tunnel sloping down. as you exit out, you'll arrive at a well-lit structure. there is a ghost glovewort (1) plant near the stalagmite in front of you, and behind the stalagmite is a corpse that holds shattershard arrows (fletched) x10. there is another corpse in that left corner that holds a smithing stone (3) . heading up the steps on the right, pass along the walkway (to the right being the uhl palace ruins you saw earlier) and on the opposite end of the walkway is a site of grace. ride the lift down next to the site of grace and to the right, on the far side of the waterfall is a corpse holding a golden rune (1) . there is a ghost glovewort (1) plant along the right-hand wall, a corpse with a golden rune (3) along the left, a corpse with a golden rune (2) in the corner of the ruins and another with a smithing stone (1) just to the left of the destroyed statue head. in this area and the ruins beyond it, there are dozens and dozens of clayman warriors, often roaming the area in small clusters, so try and lure a couple out at a time to ensure you don't get overwhelmed. before continuing, it might be worth backtracking to the platform beyond the ant queen and drop down off the left side onto the pillar. the corpse at the end has a smithing stone (4) , and dropping off onto the rocky platform to the left has a corpse holding a celestial dew , an extremely rare item. you can then drop down again to the uhl palace ruins, and either pass through the main entrance or head around the right-hand side of the statue to the right of the entrance, jump over the rocks, and find a secret passage. this passage can help you in avoiding the projectiles that the malformed star hanging from the ceiling across the way fires. there are a number of corpses with smithing stones , golden runes , a furlcalling finger remedy , magic grease and throwing daggers lining the right side of the room, and the central steps and structures. all of these will need to be traversed whilst keeping an eye on the projectiles being fired. if you hug the left side of this cavern, following the path of the water, you'll come across a ghost glovewort (1) plant, above which is a site of grace. upon activating it, you can continue following the water stream to emerge into a cave filled with viscera and multiple giant ants. there are a number of corpses in the room as well, holding formic rock , smithing stone (3) , the immunizing horn charm , crystal dart x5 , and a number of formic rock deposits (which you can easily mistake as bloodstains). if you head up the slope in the southwest corner, you'll face a number of basilisks that can breathe out death (curse) smoke. at the top of this slope, you'll emerge on a platform overlooking a gigantic cavern, where you can grab multiple aeonian butterfly and a somber smithing stone (3) off of a corpse. backtracking down the slope and turning left, you can grab 2 ghost glovewort plants, and after dealing with the three ants in the area, head down the slope and at the fork in the path, turn left to grab a melted mushroom off of a corpse. taking the right instead, you'll find a ghost glovewort as well as a tunnel that leads to a large open room, and a boss fight. a giant armored dragon-like warrior, the dragonkin soldier of nokstella has a limited number of highly-damaging moves in the first phase to look out for. thankfully, despite its name, the dragonkin soldier doesn't breathe fire. the majority of the attacks rely on sweeps with the arms and ground pounds. the dragonkin soldier of nokstella can swipe in all directions; left, right, back, or forward. the main strategy, particularly for melee builds, is to dodge-roll in the same direction as the swipes. if one hits you, the soldier won't pursue with a follow-up attack before you can recover, so don't begin to panic if you take a strike. you'll want to ensure, if you're a melee fighter, that you target any portion of the dragonkin soldier's body other than its chest. if the chest is where you are locked on, many of your swipes will often miss or clink against the armored belt portion of the soldier. at around 50% health, the soldier will emit a gigantic roar and will spread its wings as it becomes charged with frozen lightning. all of its swipe attacks will now be imbued with this lightning and can inflict the frostbite status effect. the soldier can fly into the air and lunge at you with a swipe, dragging itself across the floor as it lands. a dodge-roll can help to avoid that, and it will also work for the most common attack in this phase; the soldier will throw bolts of lightning onto the ground near it, which creates a streak of lightning across the floor of the arena in that direction. these will always be locked on to your location, but the ground sparks with lightning in the affected area for a couple of seconds before actually exploding with lightning, so you can sprint or roll out of the zone with relative ease. upon defeating the dragonkin soldier of nokstella, you'll earn the frozen lightning spear incantation. you will be able to activate a site of grace in this room after defeating the dragonkin soldier of nokstella, and in the chamber beneath the giant corpse in the chair is a chest that contains a great ghost glovewort . backtrack through the tunnel to the southeast, all the way to the uhl palace ruins, you can sprint to the left and get beneath the malformed star throwing projectiles and find the hermit merchant, as well as a corpse that holds the ainsel river map . then, head back out through the main entrance of the ruins and curve around to the left to go through the secret passage again, where you can sprint up the collapsed pillar, onto the top of the structure and run along to jump to a pathway leading up to the malformed star. you can defeat the malformed star with ranged attacks (bows, throwables or spells) and that will allow future traversal of this room to be much easier. you cannot explore more of ainsel unless you have completed ranni's questline by exploring nokron, the eternal city. /n caelid is one of the main regions in elden ring. this page includes an overview of the area, including all main dungeons, bosses, loot, and secrets to find in this region. caelid is the region directly east of limgrave, and is known for its barren, rot-filled landscape with red skies and terrible swamp. it is one of two regions that make up the greater caelid region along with greyoll's dragonbarrow to the north, which is even more dangerous than its southern counterpart. caelid is home to its own legacy dungeon that stands far to the southeast - redmane castle - though it is quite smaller than other main dungeons. however, there are many small dungeons, side quests, and roaming bosses to tackle as well. it is also home to a giant swamp filled with scarlet rot known as the swamp of aeonia, and features a narrow but deep ravine separating much of dragonbarrow from caelid, as well as the town of sorcery known as sellia. to reveal the details and topography of the whole caelid region, you'll need to find two map fragments at the steles located in caelid proper, and dragonbarrow. the caelid map fragment is located in plain sight along caelid's main highway that skirts the swamp of aeonia in a large half-circle, and the stele is found near the fork in the road where another path heads further southeast towards redmane castle, not far from a nomadic merchant. however the road leading to it is marked with danger, including a decaying dragon and one of the night's cavalry that patrols at night. caelid's legacy dungeon is called redmane castle , and it is the third main dungeon you will encounter naturally in elden ring. compared to previous legacy dungeons like stormveil castle, it is a much smaller experience, though the road to castle's entrance is well guarded with siege weaponry, and is the site of a warrior's festival soon to begin. the castle is ruled over by the demigod known as general starscourge radahn, though he is not in the castle itself - you can only reach him by going through. to enter the dungeon, you'll have to cross the expansive greatbridge to the island where the castle sits, and dodge the catapults and ballistas - though you'll find the main gate locked shut. instead, you'll need to head around the castle walls to the south and along the cliffs to find a rear entrance to find a way inside. when you are ready, view our redmane castle walkthrough to learn how to defeat its many enemies and find every secret within. caelid is home to a variety of different roaming world bosses , as well as certain npc invasions. boss name reward anastasia, tarnished killer sacred scorpion charm putrid avatar greenburst crystal tear ,

smoldering church to the left of the main road that connects limgrave to caelid. get ready for a battle—as soon as you enter the church, you'll be invaded by npc invader anastasia, tarnished-eater. she's relatively easy to stagger, but her curved greatswords can be deceivingly fast. upon defeat, she'll drop the sacred scorpion charm and a furcalling finger remedy. hit the site of grace inside and loot the missionary's cookbook 3 and the nomadic warrior cookbook 14 from the two corpses on the church's right before continuing onward. moving deeper into caelid from the smoldering church, you'll soon run into these run-down shacks plagued by putrid corpses and slimes. there is no major item to loot here, though you can find preserving boluses inside the main shack—an antidote to scarlet rot buildup. just be wary of the putrid corpse waiting to ambush you from the corner. there is also a site of grace by the cliffs overlooking the ruins below. this ruined camp is located below the hill where the main road continues from the shack of the rotting. now overrun by giant scavenger dogs and giant crows, this former camp contains a few great loots to pick up. before engaging in the camp, we recommend running past it and hitting the caelem ruins site of grace just further up the road. activating this site of grace will ensure an easier time to either deal with one enemy at a time or sneak up past them to loot the items safely. stealthily move up to the abandoned carriage next to the two giant scavenger dogs and grab the greatsword inside the chest. the middle of the camp contains a rune arc inside of a chest and six explosive bolts from a corpse. you'll need to dispose of the giant crow in the middle; as long as you keep the fight inside, the dogs would not join in. the teardrop scarab in the front will roll away from the camp as long as you come up behind it. kill it to get the whirl, o flame! incantation. just south of the ruined camp, caelem ruins can be spotted along the caelid highway. the highway cuts into the ruins, making it impossible to miss if you're venturing on the main road. there are tons of exploding corpses and flame chariots roaming the surrounding area. try to create distance with both of these enemies, as the former will explode and kill themselves. as for the flame chariots, fight them while riding torrent and aim for the soldier operating the chariots from the back. the eastern part of the ruins contains an entry to a boss room. inside you'll find a duo of mad pumpkin head. defeating them will reward you access to a treasure room that holds the visage shield . the forsaken ruins are the same ruins you can see from the shack of the rotting. head west from the caelem ruins, away from the highway. be careful of the giant crow duo waiting to attack from atop the nearby dead trees. there is an imp statue here that you can use a stonesword key to remove the fog from the entry of the cellar. you'll find a treasure chest inside the underground room containing the sword of st. trina . this massive fort can be accessed either by heading west of the smoldering wall site of grace or south of the forsaken ruins and hitting the fort gael north site of grace. just from afar, you'll see that radahn soldiers and radahn knights heavily guard fort gael's main entry. one radahn knight will shoot gravity arrows at you as soon as you get close to the fort's entry path. dodge everyone else and kill him for his greatbow . head to the fort's main gate and go around the corner where a radahn soldier is guarding a ladder—kill him and go up the ladder. you'll see a lion guardian and a radahn soldier down below, don't engage them until you clear the loot and enemies above. move towards the watchtower and get rid of the two radahn soldiers and one radahn knight inside. there will be a destroyed canopy with a treasure chest on the right side; loot the starscourge heirloom from it. the waygate atop the watchtower will teleport you near the entrance of redmane castle. don't worry about this yet; there are more items to grab. make your way back to the wooden stairs, clear the southwest section of the upper balconies and pull the lever to open the gate. for bow, sorcery, and incantation users, take advantage of the elevated platform close to the left of the ladder that you can jump down. you can safely kill the lion guardian from here without it ever touching you. an archway here will lead you to a room containing a chest with the katar fist weapon inside. there is no other way for melee users to fight the lion guardian than up close. you'll want to kill the lion guardian because it'll drop the ash of war: lion's claw upon defeat. loot the body next to the gate for a rune arc, and fort gael is complete. if you choose to explore the surrounding area, feel free to head out from the main entrance. if not, you can use the waygate to go to redmane castle. just a short distance southeast of fort gael lies the caelid waypoint ruins, crawling with kindreds of rot and rotten strays. the entrance to these ruins' underground chamber is located in the northwest section. the chamber is full of stone coffins that are guarded by tons of kindreds of rot. clear them to safely loot the meteoric ore blade katana from the room in the back. you can reach the cathedral of dragon communion by following the direction given by the caelid highway south site of grace, southeast of the caelid waypoint ruins. this cathedral is similar to the church of dragon communion located on the island in west limgrave . though there are no npcs here, you can perform the ritual of dragon communion by offering dragon hearts to obtain various dragon-based incantations. some of the incantations below can only be obtained after defeating various dragon bosses. cathedral of dragon communion's incantations dragon fire (dragon heart x1) agheel's flame (dragon heart x2) ( flying dragon agheel ) magma breath x5 (dragon heart x1) ( magma wyrm ) theodorix's magma (dragon heart x2) ( great wyrm theodorix ) glinstone breath (dragon heart x1) smarag's glinstone breath (dragon heart x 1) ( glinstone dragon smarag ) rotten breath (dragon heart x1) ekzykes's decay (dragon heart x2) ( decaying ekzykes's ) dragon ice (dragon heart x1) borealis's mist (dragon heart x2) ( borealis the freezing fog ) dragonclaw (dragon heart x1) dragonmaw (dragon heart x1) greyoll's roar (dragon heart x3) ( elder dragon greyoll ) this sub-region of caelid is situated dead center in the region and accessible by horseback from almost all directions. there are three sites of grace that you can interact with here. next to the aeonia swamp shore site of grace, you'll see green tracks from the invisible teardrop scarab. kill it to obtain the ash of war: poisonous mist . another teardrop scarab is just south of the commander o'neil boss fight that drops the ash of war: sacred ring of light when killed. if you head north from the western shore of the swamp, you'll soon find the street of sage ruins. try to clear the area of enemies here while on horseback to avoid getting infected by the scarlet rot. you can loot the traveler's set from a corpse inside the ruined structures. head northwest and dispose of the servants of rot guarding the underground cellar's entryway and grab the rock sling sorcery spell from inside the chest. lastly, loot the meteorite staff from the corpse hanging on a window near the staircase before heading to the northeasternmost corner of the swamp to grab the poison armament incantation from another teardrop scarab. this once-great town known for its mastery of different sorcery arts is now just another victim to the ever-growing scarlet rot. there are tons of items to grab here, from ashes of war to unique weapons and armor. the former town is also the only way to get to dragonbarrow from caelid. sellia is now home to spectral versions of noble sorcerers, glintstone sorcerers, and twinsage sorcerers. these guys have the same stats as their standard counterparts, except they turn invisible when you get too close. you can and should use torrent and your choice of spirit summon to clear the area of enemies and loot without hassle. while exploring the town, you'll notice these blue magic barriers blocking something behind them. to remove them, you'll need to light up the three braziers located atop the various buildings in the town. now that you've disabled all of the magic barriers go back to the main entrance so you can grab all the notable loot one by one. if you haven't done so, be sure to activate the redmane painting to the right of the town's central road. keep going forward until you get to the intersection; there is a chest in a tiny room containing the night comet spell. head northeast around the corner and pick up the imbued stonesword key from the formerly blocked small treasure chest room. you can also loot a corpse holding the cerulean tear scarab helmet on the roof of the same building. when done looting all the items here, make your way west of the town and hit the sellia under-stair site of grace if you haven't done so already. there is a boss fight just to the left of the golden seed location. there is not much to say about the nox swordstress & nox priest fight outside of the fact that it's a duo boss. nox swordstress uses a sword that can also be used as a flail, allowing her to attack from close to medium-range, while nox priest supports from afar using sorceries. they are both extremely susceptible to guard breaks, as you can pretty much cancel their combos with any attack regardless of your weapon of choice. using any spirit summoning for this fight makes it a straightforward boss fight. they drop the nox flowing sword upon defeat. you can pick up the lusat's glinstone staff further into the boss room from the chest inside the building. go back to where you pick up the golden seed and through the formerly barricaded back entry. hit the sellia backstreets site of grace before heading towards dragonbarrow . go up the road from the sellia backstreets site of grace until you find the church on the southern end. you can find millicent on the floor in pain from a scarlet rot-inflicted illness. millicent questline is tied to gowry in gowry's shack, right outside of sellia, town of sorcery. there is no notable loot here outside of the sacred tear in front of the statue. you can access the upper portion of sellia gateway by moving south from the church of the plague. the gateway also serves as a bridge that connects you to the plateau where the swamp lookout tower is located. a bloodhound knight is guarding the tower, so be careful. there is the eternal darkness sorcery inside as well. the road to redmane castle begins with the nomadic merchant at the caelid highway south intersection. going east would lead you to sellia, town of sorcery, and redmane castle to the south. in a pit by some rocks, you can find the windy crystal tear just southeast of the nomadic merchant. go back to the main road by heading south and pick up the golden seed from the miniature erdtree. keep going on the main road until you find the impassable bridge site of grace. there are two notable items to grab near the site of grace, the ash of war: cragblade from a scarab in the sword monument, and the arrow's sting talisman from a chest inside the tower next to the site of grace. for the latter, be wary of the few redmane soldiers inside the tower; they can knock you off the platform if you're not careful. as you explore this region, you may come across several scarabs scampering away. some of them will refill your flask of tears, but others can reward you with special items: reward: whirl, o flame spell you can find this scarab not far into the caelid region along the main road where a caravan has been ransacked by several large scavenger dogs and crows. the scarab is on the road just outside the camp - but be wary you don't get ambushed. reward: somber smithing stone 4 on the western side of caelid near the region's entrance is a large ruin patrolled by giant crows. hidden to the south is a scarab, but it's craftily hiding on the other side of a large root suspended above the ground by a bit. shoot it down and then defeat it. reward: ash of war - flame of the redmanes this scarab can't be seen normally, as it's invisible, but leaves a long trail as it circles around the path leading to the defended fort gael on the western edge of the region. look for the trail north of the fort's guarded entrance. reward: ash of war - lifesteal fist traveling along the main road through caelid path the smoldering wall, you can find this scarab out on the road not far from a site of grace, as well as a nomadic merchant. reward: poison armament spell on the north side of the swamp of aeonia in the center of caelid is the entrance to the sellia crytal tunnel some players get transported to early on. just outside the mine at the edge of the scarlet rot swamp, you can spot a trail of light weaving in and out of poison muck. it's best to just wait by the shore and watch the trail stand in its way and attack as it gets close. reward: ash of war - poisonous mist another scarab hides among the poison swamps of aeonia, located on the southwestern side. annoyingly, it likes to teleport around, so you may need to sprint at it with torrent to kill it quickly or snipe from a distance. reward: ash of war - sacred ring of light a third scarab also hides in the swamp of aeonia in central caelid - this one lingers behind the heart of aeonia where the world boss commander o'neil waits. just to the east is a small passage behind the arena filled with large flying bugs, and the scarab (which will explode after being killed). reward: ash of war - double slash northeast of the swamp of aeonia is the magical town of sellia, filled with cloaked magic users. many roots weave up and around the town and its buildings, and you can climb onto the rooftops with torrent to find a scarab hiding among the raised roots. reward: somber smithing stone 4 to the south part of caelid near redmane castle is the dungeon entrance along the southwestern coastline. here you'll find a scarab along the road to the caelid catacombs entrance - but be wary of the giant crow waiting to ambush you. reward: ash of war - cragblade in the very southeast corner of the map lies redmane castle, and just before the impassible great bridge is a low rise with a series of swords and a marker. a scarab lurks among this sword grave. reward: ash of war - flaming strike technically located outside the legacy dungeon of redmane castle, this scarab can be found in a small cemetery full of vampire bats behind the castle, where you need to go to use a ladder to infiltrate the castle. /n greyoll's dragonbarrow is a sub-region in elden ring, located directly north of mainland caelid . this page includes an overview of the area, including all main dungeons, bosses, loot, and secrets to find in this region. dragonbarrow is named for the many dragons that call this stretch of land their home. these dragons reside on the hills and plateaus of dragonbarrow—escaping the curse of scarlet rot that's plaguing the lands of caelid to the south. there are three ways to access dragonbarrow; you can either travel here through the backstreets of sellia, town of sorcery in caelid, by using the lift from siofra river, or by teleporting to the bestial sanctum from east limgrave . for the former, there will be a spiritspring jump location right before the church of the plague. there are a couple of small dungeons, side quests, and roaming bosses to tackle here. furthermore, the region is home to the divine tower of caelid, where you can restore the great rune of radahn. to reveal the details and topography of the whole caelid region, you'll need to find two map fragments at the steles located in caelid proper and dragonbarrow. the dragonbarrow map fragment is located along dragonbarrow's main road, just east of the dragonbarrow west site of grace. there

weaponry and spells at their disposal. you'll have to defeat these npc invaders one at a time to obtain the great-jar's arsenal talisman. gurranqt beast clergy man - gurranq is a unique trader npc

westernmost plateau of the sub-region. at night, a bell bearing hunter field boss will spawn outside of the isolated merchant's shack. the best way to spawn him is to rest at the site of grace inside of the shack, pass the time until nightfall, rest once more, and step outside. the isolated merchant would not spawn at night until you beat this boss. in addition, there is a tear drop scarab on a nearby cliff that drops the ash of war: skyshot when killed. there is not much to say about this particular well other than the fact that it connects the underground siofra river to the continent of caelid. the deep siofra well site of grace is also the closest grace site to the colosseum to the north. the great-jar is a non-speaking npc that's only there to reward you with a talisman once you defeat the three npc invaders. the npc invaders are random every time to simulate battling a player invader. you can only summon and fight one at a time—you can find the summoning signs directly in front of the great-jar. defeating all three will reward you with the great-jar's arsenal talisman, allowing you to increase your equipment load vastly. this location, while not marked on the map, can be found right outside of fort faroth . greyoll is a massive elder dragon that dwarfs all other dragons you've encountered. she is mainly immobile and surrounded by 5 smaller dragons, presumably her children. greyoll has a huge health pool and will take a while to defeat if you choose only to attack her. you can do this by hitting her left side, where her wing will block her children from being able to attack you. the other tactic is to kill the 5 smaller dragons around her; killing one will deal 1/5 damage to her. greyoll drops x5 dragon heart when killed, and it'll also unlock the elden dragon greyoll's roar incantation at the cathedral of dragon communion in caelid. there is also a few upgrade materials you can find on top of the giant skull near her location. you can get up there by using the spiritspring below it. fort faroth is an abandoned fort now inhabited by vampire bats and vampire crones. be sure to hit the site of grace outside before heading in. as you first walk inside, you'll notice several vampire bats and vampire crones roosting from above the ceiling and throughout the floor. though they are relatively weak, you can get overwhelmed by their attacks and poison clouds if you fight them alone. we highly recommend summoning a spirit ash to explore this location. the roof of the fort is occupied by several spectral redmane soldiers, varying in weapons of choice. clear the area of enemies and grab the dectus medallion (right) from the inside of a chest before heading back down to explore for more loot. the first hole you encounter will lead you back to where you fought the group of vampire mobs. the second hole will lead you to a wooden platform with some rats hidden behind some boxes. there is a set of platforms you can jump on from where you find the first rat; be wary of the giant rat that's waiting to ambush you around the corner. go down using the ladder and grab the radagon soreseal legendary talisman from the corpse on the floor. lenne's rise is located directly east of the minor erdtree, slightly below the bridge that connects the bestial sanctum plateau to the main landmass of dragonbarrow. though a magic barrier locks the entrance to the tower, you can get inside by using the nearby spiritspring and aiming for the eastern balcony. if that proves too tricky, you can land on the roof of lenne's rise and slide down. the inside of the tower is relatively straightforward. take the lift up and loot the memory stone from the chest. the bestial sanctum might be the first location in dragonbarrow that players encounter, as you'll be teleported here after chatting with d, hunter of the dead, and taking the waygate in east limgrave. you'll find gurranq, beast clergyman here—an npc eternally hungry to devour death. you can give him deathroot in exchange for different goods. be careful after giving him the 4th deathroot, as gurranq will become hostile. you'll need to deal a certain amount of damage to calm him down before being able to interact with him again. outside of the bestial sanctum is the field boss black blade kindred, guarding the entrance to the refuge and defeating this boss when early in the game can prove challenging. you can find the dragoncrest shield talisman on the bottom level of the structure below the cliffs surrounding the bestial sanctum. you'll need to jump down the big roots to the west of the bestial sanctum to make it down. from there you'll want to carefully make your way down the structures until you see some vampire bats and sanctuary stones scattered on the floor; you want to stay in this corner—hugging the cliffs as you jump down. keep moving across the platform and pick up the cinqueda from the beast's corpse. not far from here is the noble's corpse holding the dragoncrest talisman. as you explore this region, you may come across several scarabs scampering away. some of them will refill your flask of tears, but others can reward you with special items. reward: ash of war - skyshot you can find this scarab just northwest of the isolated merchant's shack, near the edge of the cliffs that drop to the ravine below. reward: somber smithing stone 9 in the far northeast corner of dragonbarrow you can find the bestial sanctum, and below that is a greatbridge where a giant dragon stands guard. on the north side of the bridge, head west among the rock area to find a series of pillars full of animal bones in a tight clump, and a scarab hides among them. /n redmane castle is a dungeon found in the southeast corner of the caelid area in elden ring. it is a small castle without much going on, but serves as the access point for the boss battle against one of the elden lords. this page will contain walkthrough and guide information on how to reach redmane castle, all the treasures and items that can be found inside, and how to defeat its fearsome boss. how to get to redmane castle redmane castle walkthrough redmane castle mid-boss fight redmane castle festival walkthrough starscourge radahn boss fight redmane castle in the bottom-most corner of the caelid region, far away from most of the places you have been up to this point in this guide. so to

will find a cellar full of rats and a treasure chest that, when opened, ensnares you and sends you to a hut inside the sellia crystal tunnel . exit the hut and take an immediate right. and run down the hill and past all the crystal miners. at the bottom of the mine you will see a tunnel that takes you back to the mine entrance, where you can activate the site of grace. step outside of the tunnel and you will find yourself looking out over a rotten swamp in caelid. hop onto torrent and ride down to the beach front, then go left and follow the beach until you find the sellia under stair site of grace among some rubble between the swamp and the city of sellia. from here, head up the nearby staircase and into sellia, town of sorcery. immediately turn toward the south and follow the main road through the town and out the front gate. keep following this road and you will eventually pass right through the sellia gateway. keep following this same road south-southeast and you will eventually come across the southern aeonia swamp bank site of grace. follow the road a little further west and you will come across a merchant as well as the area map. with the map in hand you can now see the castle to the southeast. keep following the road, being careful not to engage with any of the enemies along the way. you will go right past a golden seed , so be sure to grab that before you continue. ride to the end of this road and you will reach the impassable greatbridge site of grace behind a giant siege machine. hop back on torrent and ride across the bridge, avoiding the shots from the flame turrets, then weave around the enemies and ramparts as you follow the road on the other side all the way up to the castle gates. unfortunately the gate is closed, so we will have to take the long way. turn right at the gate and ride along the cliffs where you will discover a secret path around the castle. there are some bats in the way, but as long as you don't get hit you can just jump right over them. in the back is a small graveyard where you will find a ladder leading up to the top of the castle walls. climb to the top, then make your way down the wooden walkway to the right to reach a roof within the castle walls. use the ladder to get down into the castle, then enter the nearby doorway to get into the barracks and open the backdoor into the castle so you don't have to take the ladder on future visits. in these barracks you can also find a smithing stone [5] and the armorer's cookbook [5]. because redmane castle is so small there isn't much of a walkthrough needed, but there are a couple random items we can find before heading to the boss. exit the barracks and jump over the wall behind the stake of marika to reach a lower section of the castle. climb the stairs to get into the guard tower on your left where you will find a golden rune [6]. straight ahead you will see a plaza with two of the powerful lion enemies we have faced in the past. ignore them for now and go right instead where you will see a set of stairs and a teleporter that will take you out of the castle and back to the impassable greatbridge. follow the road at the top of the stairs forward and you will encounter a heavily guarded rampart, full of soldiers and flame turrets. sneak past or push through to reach the other side where you will see a small room with a site of grace inside. with the site of grace active you can go back and kill both of the lions, though i recommend using a ranged weapon to draw them out one at a time. each one will drop a somber smithing stone [4], beast blood , and old fang . search the courtyard here to find an arteria leaf and a smithing stone [4]. head back to the site of grace from before and step out the side door where you will see a boss door directly ahead. at first this fight seems to be simply another encounter with the leonine misbegotten, similar to the one you would have faced at castle morne . however about halfway through the fight the leonine will be joined by a crucible knight, complicated things immensely. when it comes to the leonine, i cannot stress enough how important it is to get a shield with the barricade shield ability. when active this ability to causes almost all of the leonine's sword attacks to bounce off, leaving it open to a free guard counter. this makes any encounter with a leonine fairly trivial, and makes this encounter much easier. once the crucible knight joins the battle your focus should be on finishing the leonine first because you do not want to have to juggle these two combatants. thankfully the leonine is a much faster moving opponent, so you can draw it away from the knight and continue your barricade into counter assault until he is defeated. with the leonine out of the way you can focus on the more daunting foe, the crucible knight. this foe has powerful multi-hit combos with deceptive pauses between attacks, and is not easily guard broken. because of all of this it is my opinion that the best way to deal with the crucible knights is to simply parry them. sadly we had a barricade shield shield equipped to deal with the leonine, so you will need to back up and do a quick menu to swap your shield. keep your shield up and wait for one of his telegraphed diagonal slashes which more easily parried than his more powerful swings. it may take a few attempts to get the timing right, but this is a good way to start yourself on the journey toward parry mastery. if you cannot master the parry timing you will have to wait out one of his heavy slam or powerful thrusts that he usually reserves for the end of a combo, which give you a small window to get a hit or two in before he starts up again. at half health the knight will power up and incorporate some dragon magic into his arsenal. your best bet against these attacks is to simply not engage. back away or try and strafe behind him if you see the fire breath, and dodge roll away when he begins his tail swings when he goes up for his flying dive attack you want to wait till the moment he charges and dodge through it. you will want to keep waiting for his normal sword combos to punish (yet another reason why parrying is optimal here, more damage when he does leave himself open means less chances for him to use his magic). with the mid-bosses defeated reload the area and return to the boss arena where you should now see a bunch of npcs gathered together. a crier standing on the gate ahead will announce the start of the festival. go through the gate and up the stairs so you can speak to him directly. he will ask if you are ready for the festival. say yes to watch a cutscene explaining the story behind radahn, then you be taken to the beginning of the radahn festival, where you will also be given the heartening cry emote. turn around and enter the building behind the gate. walk into the chapel, grab the smithing stone [6] from the altar, then exit and find the elevator that takes you down to the beach behind the castle. run down to the teleporter in the water and use it to be taken to the boss arena. starscourge radahn is a powerful elden lord who stalks the wailing wastes. the battle against him is an interesting mix of fun and challenge, but can be a little tedious and random. the battle will begin the instant you spawn into the wailing wastes, and radahn will begin firing powerful arrows at you right away. wait until the moment just before the arrow reaches you, then dodge roll side to side. you need to do this a few times at the start of the fight, so keep your eye on him at all times. the gimmick of this battle is that you get to summon a handful of npcs to assist you in the festival. you will see their summon signs scattered all over the sand in front of you. dash over to the signs and summon the npcs in-between arrow shots until all of the possible allies have been summoned so that the real battle can begin. the allies you can summon include: great horned tragoth, who wields a giant hammer lionel the lionhearted, who summons large groups of homing souls okina, a samurai who uses fiery blood slice attacks alexander the iron fist , the warrior jar you may have met earlier in the game blaidd the half-wolf , another warrior you may have met earlier as part of ranni's questline patches (if you met and didn't kill him, though he'll take a few steps before deciding to quickly leave instead of fighting) finger maiden therolina, who can be summoned near the top of the dunes and will invoke healing spells to try and bolster the group radahn will change up his strategy and start firing shotgun blasts of arrows as well as a homing rain of arrows. during this period just strafe around at a safe distance until your npc army reach him and he switches to melee attacks. at this point you want to hop on torrent and run in with the rest of your allies. mounting up for this battle isn't 100% required, but due to the incredible onslaught of his moves, it's highly recommended to stay mobile on horseback unless you are an expert at dodging rapid attacks. this is where the battle becomes a little unpredictable. radahn has many powerful wide reaching attacks, and he moves around incredibly fast. he will start lashing out at the various summoned npcs, killing most of them with ease. it is during these periods of distraction that you want to dash past on torrent and execute a hit and run. try and pick a weapon with good range and damage because you will only be hitting him once or twice per pass (bleed doesn't hurt either). try to mostly hit him in the back, as he will likely be attacking forward when trying to hit your summoned allies. your goal is to never be the center of attention, and run away any time he turns to you. stick around too long, and it's more than likely you'll be caught in a sweeping strike, stunning torrent long enough that you won't be able to dash away in time to evade a killing blow. keep in mind that most of his attacks are multi-hit combos. his most punishable attacks are his double weapon overhead slams. he has 2-3 different ones so just keep an eye on him. anytime you see him slam both his weapons into the ground is an opening to attack. just be careful of the purple charged blades, which result in a massive explosion when he pulls them back out of the ground. if you are lucky your allies may even hit him enough times to trigger a stagger, at which point you can hop off torrent and get a powerful attack in. you should also consider crafting tons of rowa raisins to feed torrent during parts of the battle where you're not under attack. losing torrent in a battle like this can often spell instant death, and your mount doesn't always regen to full health when you die and respawn - so top him off before going back for another attempt! radahn also has a few ranged blade attacks to keep in mind, the first a volley of purple orbs that can be easily dodged by strafing. the second is a wave of electricity that runs across the ground, which you need to double-jump over with torrent - and leaping over this dive attack can often give you a free hit or two. when radahn reaches 50% health he will leap into the sky, disappearing from the battle for about 10 seconds. use this time to heal and look for any nearby summon signs, which will reappear for anyone who was killed during phase one. keep an eye on the sky, because you will be able to see radahn coming as he shoots back down to earth. at this point, you'll also get one more ally to summon who has been added to the mix: castellan jerren, the master of ceremonies for the festival who wields a fiery flamberge. in phase two radahn gains some new tricks, but with your refreshed gang of summoned allies backing you the strategy remains mostly the same. his attacks become more powerful and gain wider ranges or more serious effects. you need to focus up and redouble your efforts here and not let the fight go long enough for radahn to kill all your allies again, or use his powerful meteor summons which are both difficult to dodge and deadly. all in all, this is a boss battle that can be considered at least partially luck based. if your summoned allies stay alive and do their job radahn may never even look at you, letting you get free hits and staggers. but if he kills them all off with one or two combos you may be left running for your life. once you've mastered the above mentioned patterns it will just come down to the number of attempts, so keep at it and eventually the festival will end with you the victor. killing radahn will get you the remembrance of the starscourge , and radahn's great rune . it will also trigger a cutscene that shows a meteor landing somewhere on the map, which will trigger a continuation of ranni's questline... /n nokron, eternal city is a location underground, one level above siofra river , in elden ring. it is an optional underground area slightly more linear than the overworld, but keeps many of its core mechanics. the ability to ride torrent, fast travel, and the restoration of flasks upon defeating enemy groups persist whilst underground. this page contains

glovewort , crucible hornshield , gargoyle's greatsword , gargoyle's twinblade whilst you can technically visit a portion of nokron via the waygate at the top of the ruins in the center of siofra river, where you face the dragonkin soldier, you can only access the city itself after defeating starscourge radahn . with radahn beaten, teleport to fort haight west in eastern limgrave , south of mistwood, and upon arrival you'll see to the northwest a huge crater has formed with rocks floating into the sky from the center. head to the northern side and you'll see a slope leading down. jump from platform to platform and pass through the tunnel to the north to enter a ruined building. dropping down to the base level, progress forward to emerge into nokron. to begin with, you'll emerge into a large cavern filled with dilapidated cathedral-type buildings. as you drop down onto the roof below, and along the first column, as you jump up to the small square platform, turn right to face the east and you'll see a corpse on the roof across the chasm. from the northwest corner of this small platform, perform a running jump to land on the column and then run up and jump across to loot the corpse and gain the ghostflame torch . drop off the northwestern side to get a drop attack on a silver tear, then continue around the side to face two more silver tears on the left, and four up the roofs to the right. take the ramp up the collapsed building and follow along the narrow edge of the next building to pass through an open window arch to the left (pictured above). drop down the platforms and deal with the two fallen hawks soldiers patrolling, as well as the three archers at the back of the room. heading down the steps you'll find a site of grace. past the site of grace, you'll emerge into a kind of town center, with a number of buildings to explore in/around. there are dozens of fallen hawks soldiers roaming this zone, so be careful as you go around corners and avoid getting swamped in the center of the area where a lot of them are congregated. there are many dew kissed herba , melted mushroom , and silver tear husk to collect, as well as silver firefly groups on the southwest ridge. to the northeast there will be a large set of stairs leading down, turning right as you reach the bottom you'll be faced with a swordstress and a silver tear. beyond them continue down towards the large pantheon, upon entering which you'll be faced with a boss fight. the mimic tear acts as a replica of yourself. though it begins as a blob on the floor, upon approach it will take your form, and possess all of your abilities and equipped items. as such, the strategy you'll need to take will vary wildly depending on your build. if you're spell-focused, time your casts so that the mimic can't catch you out with its own spells. if you're melee-focused, you'll want to be watching out for parries and heavy attacks that the mimic will attempt. something you can do to give yourself an upper hand is to immediately summon spirit ashes , as this will provide distractions for the mimic. upon defeating the mimic tear, you'll earn a larval tear and the silver tear mask . take a look at our guide to see how to get the mimic tear spirit ashes . upon defeating the mimic tear, activate the site of grace to the left and then continue up the steps and ride torrent down the long pathway. as you begin to near the end, to the left is a slope leading down into a forested area with large numbers of ancestral followers. you'll note immediately on the left side of the stone path is a pillar. interact with it to ignite it (which you'll need to find the others similar to the base level of siofra river). from this first pillar head northwest to the ridge with the ancestral follower shaman. dealing with the shaman, you can light the pillar next to it. from there, head northeast, and on the cliff edge to the right of the last stone column is another pillar. then head northwest and in a small open pantheon area with an ancestor spirit corpse, you'll find the next pillar guarded by some ancestral followers and an ancestral shaman. continue northwest to the giant stone column surrounded by wolves and a variant of the red wolf of radagan. tucked on the far side of this stone column is another pillar to light. the final pillar is due north from that position, with the pillar being on the cliff edge guarded by two ancestral follower shamans and some small rats. with all the pillars now lit, head back down east and find the pillars lining the stone staircase are also lit (similar to the procedure down at siofra river), and upon climbing the stairs and interacting with the corpse at the far end of the structure, you'll be initiated into a boss fight. very similar to the ancestor spirit you will fight on the base level of siofra river , the regal ancestor spirit has a few unique caveats. the ancestor spirit will often perform a three-bounce jump into the air, with the third bounce holding in the air for a moment before the ancestor spirit slams down creating a shockwave. it can also bounce into the air and then run through the air as it performs a strafing run, breathing blue fire. similar in style to the dragons in elden ring, but this strafing run attack is far easier to avoid, even without torrent. the breath of the ancestor spirit doesn't spread out horizontally once it hits the floor, so keep moving as the boss takes to the air and move in the opposite direction as it starts to fire. there are also a number of ram attacks that the ancestor spirit can perform, either a charge in a straight line or dashing to the side and diagonally thrusting with its horns. both will stagger or throw you into the air depending on your build but can be dodged through if you roll towards the spirit just as it reaches you. the ancestor spirit can also breathe its fire as it walks towards you, but this requires you to be in close proximity to its head, which rarely happens due to the maneuverability in play during this encounter. if you spend too long behind it, it will kick out with its hind legs which will knock you over if it connects. there are also two stomp attacks the spirit will utilize depending on your position in relation to it. at a distance, it can perform a charge 3-move combo, swinging its head from side to side before rearing up into the air and stomping down in a shockwave. if you are beneath it, it can rear up on its hind legs and slam down in an identical shockwave. the aforementioned unique caveats are that this ancestor spirit can imbue many of its attacks with magic, making them hit far harder. this is particularly evident with the horn rams. the spirit can also rear up on its hind legs and bunny hop around you, locking on with each return to the ground, so keep running and rolling should you see the spirit begin to glow and pose like a kangaroo. aside from its ability to teleport, the main road bump in this fight is that as the spirits health gets low, it can begin absorbing in a spherical radius around itself the life force of nearby beings. that is the purpose of the dozens of passive spirit animals in the arena. the bad news is that this absorption can almost impact you and quickly diminish your health while replenishing its own, so run like lightning away from the spirit if you see it initiate a call and start pulsing and emitting light. upon defeating the regal ancestor spirit, you'll earn the remembrance of the regal ancestor . back in the ancestral woods, make your way southwest behind the ancestral shaman by the pillar to head up a slope and find a site of grace. from this site of grace, jump off the right side of the cliff face to land on the roof of the building below. jump down the far end and loop around to the right to enter night's sacred ground. jump across the gap onto the balcony below, then jump down again and loop around to jump to the domed roof on the left. jumping down from there you'll face two silver tears; one will take the form of you with a crossbow, and the one further back will wield a melee weapon. head around the corner of the building in the southeast, then drop onto the top of the destroyed arch. crossing over, you'll be able to drop into a large cathedral. head to the back left-hand side to find an imp seal. unlocking it with a stonesword key , you'll progress down a small corridor and face a swordstress. inside the chest she was guarding are the mimic tear ashes , an incredibly powerful spirit ash to possess. heading back out and down the ladder to the lower level, you'll spot a living boulder (which you can kill for a larval tear) and a swordstress beyond. you can actually sneak past these two, but be wary of a second swordstress in the alcove to the right of the chairs. passing through the open doors and down the stairs on the right, you'll see another site of grace to the left, and to the right, there's a long walkway filled with silver tears. one will transform to a spear and shield-wielded warrior, and the last one closest to the steps at the far end transforms into a troll. once they are all cleared, inside the base of the giant throne is a chest containing the fingerslayer blade and a great ghost glovewort . there is a waygate to the left at the bottom of the steps to the throne that will transport you back to the ancestral woods site of grace. to the north of hallowhorn grounds are some jellyfish floating amongst the trees. head towards them and on the cliff edge is a corpse with an old fang . below the cliff edge they occupy, you'll be able to drop down onto a ledge that leads left into a cave. before you head into the cave, on the right side of this lower platform is a corpse with a stonesword key . inside the cave, you'll pass a couple more jellyfish and then discover a site of grace. from the site of grace, follow the tunnel heading east then at the edge drop off onto the column bridging the gap, then down onto the lower platform where a lesser crucible knight is patrolling. a good strategy is to head to one of the open archways in these structures, and get the knight to half health where it will begin performing the flying sweeping attacks. if you can line it up properly, you can goad the knight into performing this flying sweep and diving off the edge, killing it instantly and earning you the crucible hornshield . in the structure to the southwest, you'll find a corpse with the missionary's cookbook (5) . continue north and you'll face another lesser crucible knight overlooking the edge of the aqueduct. this knight wields a large mace-type weapon, identical to the one you encounter in road's end catacombs. whilst there isn't a foolproof method like the first knight, this one is prone to stagger should you perform 3-4 jumping attacks. in the room to the east are three fallen hawks soldiers; one with a sword, one with a shield, and one archer. they will come attack if you aggro the knight, so it's often best to deal with them first. heading outside to the south from the room with the fallen hawks soldiers, enter the structure and find a golden centipede on the floor in the center. there will also be a scarab to kill that drops the order healing incantation. around the back ledge of the building is a corpse with a golden rune (7) . out of the northwestern exit (where the destroyed bridge is) there is a corpse hanging off the edge with a golden rune (13) . heading back inside and going upstream, a corpse lies in the water holding a golden rune (6) . you can either go left or right from here. there is also however a secret room hidden behind the waterfall with four fallen hawks soldiers inside. there is also a golden centipede and a corpse holding a smithing stone (4) . to the left is a small room with three fallen hawks soldiers, a corpse holding a rune arc , and a golden centipede in the south corner. you are likely to also draw the attention of the four additional fallen hawks soldiers (if you haven't dealt with them behind the waterfall), who will come up from behind whilst you're in this room, so don't let yourself get ambushed. taking the right from the aqueduct, you'll find a golden centipede against the outer wall and another near the banister, as well as an npc cowering that will give you the inner order emote upon talking to him. move up the stairs to the northwest and you'll enter a boss arena. this fight can be devastatingly punishing if you go in underprepared or ill-equipped. it is recommended, if you're a melee build, to have a blunt weapon of at least +9 to deal sufficient damage. it's also a very good idea to bring the mimic tear ashes into the fight, upgraded to around +8 - the mimic can draw aggro from one or both of the gargoyles and can replicate the damage output of whatever build you are using. upon entering the arena, you'll face the gargoyle with the greatsword and axe who will jump down from a ledge to the back right. this gargoyle focuses on rapid slashing combos and swings with its axe, and like its counterpart which enters the fight later, can emit a poisonous cloud from its mouth. this poisonous cloud is deadliest in immediate proximity to the gargoyles, and will mostly spread in a straight line ahead of the gargoyle. as such, back away from the gargoyle and sprint/dodge to the side as it begins emitting the poison. the slashing combo most likely to catch you out is a double set of two slashes back and forth, ending in an overhead slam down. rolling towards the gargoyle can help you evade the slashes, but unless you perfectly time your rolls the slam can catch you out. this gargoyle will occasionally fly backward into the air and linger for a second before performing a sweep with the axe as it flies towards you and slams into the ground. as the majority of these attacks are dangerous to block, and you can't ride torrent in this arena despite its size, you'll be needing to dodge roll as much as possible. distracting it with your mimic tear ashes can allow you to easily get in some jumping heavy attacks, which if successfully executed half a dozen times can stagger the gargoyle and allow a critical strike. when the greatsword/axe gargoyle drops to around two-thirds to 50% health, the second gargoyle (wielding a twin-blade) will emerge from the waterfall at the back of the arena. keep your focus on the first gargoyle, and if you can, keep your combat against it as close to the entrance as possible to extend the time it takes for the second gargoyle to reach the fight. you are most likely to be overwhelmed, surrounded, and die if both gargoyles are alive, very close to you, and can maneuver 360 degrees around you. keeping the wall of the entryway close limits their range of movement, but as a trade-off pins you in a little more than being in the open of the center of the arena. the twin-blade gargoyle is by far more aggressive than the first, performing similar swipes to the greatsword gargoyle, but this gargoyle is airborne far more often and can perform flurries where it juggles the twin-blade and creates a whirlwind. the main attack to look out for is spinning the twin-blade rapidly, where it then takes to the sky, lingers for a moment and then lunges with the tip of the blade in your direction, bringing the spinning vortex with it. as it lands, it performs a 360-degree spin with the blade which can easily catch you out if you dodge its dive too soon. upon defeating the valiant gargoyles, you'll earn the gargoyle's greatsword and gargoyle's twinblade weapons. at the back of the arena is a coffin that you can interact with, climb inside and ride up the waterfall to arrive at deeproot depths . /n the altus plateau is one of the main regions in elden ring. this page includes an overview of the area, including all main dungeons, bosses, loot, and secrets to find in this region. the altus plateau is the region directly north of liurnia, and is known for being the gateway to the capital city of leyndell, and sits between the capital outskirts to the east, and the volcanic mt gelmir to the west. it can be reached either through the grand lift of dectus (which requires finding both halfs of the medallion needed to activate it), or the perilous journey up the ruin-strewn precipice nearby - which leads to a narrow mountain pass into the plateau. the plateau is home to large plains that still bear marks from the shattering war when the capital itself was sieged, as many encampments still stand. it is also home to a large fog-filled valley full of creatures that lurk around the minor erdtree and broken bridge that onces spanned it - and several windmill villages to the north. to reveal the details and topography of the whole altus plateau region, you'll need to find three map fragments at the steles located in the altus plateau proper, as well as mt gelmir and the capital outskirts . the altus plateau map fragment is located along one of its main roads after breaking off north from the road leading to the southern capital entrance. the path is lightly patrolled by a few soldiers and undead, and you may also find brother corhyn nearby. the altus plateau is home to a variety of different roaming world bosses, as well as certain npc invasions. boss

windmill village. either way, she'll appear near the boss area after he's dead. boc - if you've followed his questline from limgrave to liurnia , giving him both the sewing needle and golden sewing needle, he'll appear at the altus highway junction site of grace once you rest at it. the poor little guy will ask permission to call you "lord", and continue to help alter your garments free of charge. yura - the culmination of yura's battle against the bloody fingers ends at the second church of marika. here you'll find the dying bloody finger hunter and his extremely long weapon, the

you locate goldmask to the north, corhyn will stand by his side, and continue to sell you a few incantations on the side. brother corhyn's incantations urgent heal (1,000 runes) heal (1,500 runes)

enemy camps, and other points of interest that you can discover in your journeys. though they differ in the enemies and treasure found within, each place has something worth discovering. click on a

of dectus and instead use the mines inside the ruin-strewn precipice, you'll be on this side of the altus plateau. there are tons of omens roaming around the area and on top of the abandoned coffins. going up the main path from the nearby site of grace will initiate the field boss fight ancient dragon lansseax . the fight against it can be difficult due to the small and elevated hills, so we recommend you lure the dragon towards the shallow lake to the northwest. be sure to loot the ruler's mask and the ruler's robe from the corpses on top of the coffins. this location is also where you can invade great horned taragoth as part of the volcano manor assassination questline. be sure to stock up on neutralizing boluses before exploring the perfumer's ruins, as it is filled with poison-using perfumers and miranda flowers. though they are weak, try to take the fight one section at a time to avoid getting cornered. an omenkiller guards the large room in the middle, be wary of his fire attacks. once you've killed him, loot the omenkiller armor set that he drops. the perfumer's cookbook 1 is also inside a nearby chest. there is a small room with a giant miranda flower towards the back of ruins; killing the flower will reveal a small underground cellar that holds a nascent butterfly. you can enter the unsightly catacombs located below these ruins. you can find lux ruins to the left of the grand lift of dectus or over the hill if you're coming from the abandoned coffin site of grace. these ruins are where you find rya and millicent if you're doing their questlines, with the latter being just north of the ruins. a teardrop scarab here drops the ash of war - shield crash when killed. the demi-human queen gilika boss down below is rather weak, especially to bleed buildup. clear the boss and open the door to loot the ritual sword talisman from inside the chest. the western soldier camps are located just below the hills directly east of lux ruins. they are separated into two camps, one containing a couple of carriages and a larger camp with a couple of ballistae. head to the lower camp first to loot the greatshield talisman and the troll's golden sword from the carriages' chests. make your way up the hill, clear the leyndell soldiers mounting the ballistae, then loot sacrificial twig from inside the chest by the center of the camp. there is also a golden seed to pick up nearby. located northeast of the grand lift of dectus, there is not much to do in this tiny misbegotten camp outside of the stonesword key you can loot from a nearby corpse. following the main highway from the grand lift of dectus, keep going east of the altus highway junction site of grace until you get to the southern capital gate. this location is heavily guarded by two tree sentinels and several leyndell knights and leyndell soldiers. fighting them all head-on is a poor strategy, as your chances of getting knocked of torrent by the tree sentinels are high. instead, it is recommended to run past all the enemies and hit the outer wall phantom tree site of grace behind the gate. this way, you can fight one tree sentinel at a time by initiating the battle from behind one of them. their moveset is the same as the lone tree sentinel roaming in west limgrave . they drop the erdtree greatshield when killed. you can find the second church of marika northwest of where you'd find the altus plateau mag fragment. this church is the fourth location of bloody finger hunter yura if you've been doing his quest since west limgrave , where he will give you the nagakiba katana. once you pick up the weapon, eleonora violet bloody finger will invade your world. defeat her to obtain eleonora's poleblade and the purifying crystal tear—the latter is immensely valuable against mohg, lord of blood in mohgwyn palace . be sure to pick up the sacred tear before you leave. aptly named because of its initial invisibility, the mirage rise is another sorcerer tower that requires a puzzle to be unlocked. interacting with the imp statue will reward you with the info item, mirage riddle. using the mirage riddle will open up a map that shows the approximate location of the three magic crests you'll need to disable to reveal the tower. once you've gotten all three crests, go back to the imp statue—now you can see and go inside the mirage rise. climb the ladder and grab the unseen blade and unseen form sorceries. the now broken forest-spanning greatbridge is split into two locations, north and south. you most likely will encounter the southern section first, where you'll find a nomadic merchant and a finger reader crone. the former notably sells various shields, a few stonesword keys, and the ancient dragon apostle's cookbook 2 . on the other side of the bridge, you'll encounter golden mask, a non-speaking npc connected to brother corhyn questline . below him, there is a spiritspring you can use to jump down to the forest. you can also use this spiritspring to get on the collapsed section of the bridge to grab the radiant gold mask from a corpse. these extensive ruins stretch across the eastern part of the forest, from the base of the minor erdtree to the entrance of the altus tunnel . there are tons of lesser wormfaces and slugs inhabiting the surrounding area of the ruins. assuming you're starting from the north side, there is a gravel stone and the icon shield guarded by one lesser wormface inside the ruin. be careful of their death blight spit attacks, as standing on it can cause instant death when the meter gets full. keep moving south until you get to the ruins guarded by three lesser wormfaces. the underground chamber here contains the wrath of gold incantation inside a chest. go back up and head inside the nearby smaller building to loot the nomadic warrior's cookbook 19 on the ground. a teardrop scarab nearby drops the ash of war - golden slam when killed. the easiest way to find this caravan is by traveling to the road of iniquity side path site of grace directly below the northern end of the forest-spanning greatbridge and riding west on the path. there are tons of leyndell soldiers and leyndell knights patrolling the road of iniquity. we suggest attacking the caravan early rather than waiting till it reaches the writheblood ruins because there are way more enemies there than its starting point. the chest of the wagon contains the greatstars . the writheblood ruins are located just before the bridge of iniquity, south of the main road. you can either get here by traveling down the path towards mt. gelmir or going up the platforms north of the mirage rise. there is nothing notable to loot on the ground level of the ruins, so go down the stairs to the underground chamber. the yellow fog door is the entrance for the noble sanguine boss fight. we highly recommend using a torch or a lantern against him, as the boss arena can be dark. the best way to travel to the windmill pastures is by starting from the forest-spanning greatbridge site of grace and taking the waygate next to it; doing this will ensure that you won't miss out on any significant loot. immediately after taking the waygate, there will be a battlemage on a cliff just to your left. kill him, and loot the battlemage set from his corpse. continue up the road towards the east windmill pasture; several dancers here are non-hostile. be wary of the pile of burning putrid undead in the middle guarding the noble's set—they will run towards you and explore to deal massive damage. last but not least, go towards the northern edge of the pasture and grab the twinned knight swords from the burning pile of corpses. from the east windmill pasture, ride west past the shallow pond and up the hills. the west windmill pasture is almost identical to its eastern counterpart except that rats infest this one. clear them out and loot the giant rat ashes from the corpse inside the broken-down shack. dominula is a unique location in the altus plateau that consists of both hostile and non-hostile enemies in its vicinity. the village also has a field boss encounter at the end. make sure to hit the windmill village site of grace before heading up. starting from the bottom, the dancers here are almost all non-hostile except for some holding various weapons. don't move up just yet; go directly north of the site of grace and loot the celebrant's skull warhammer from the corpse at the cliff's edge. make your way up the village, loot everything you see as you explore. dominula is an excellent spot to farm weapons and armor related to the dancers—from their sickle and cleaver to their garb and hood. though keep in mind that the drop rates are relatively low. when you come across a fork road, go south to the house with a bonfire and a few dancers dancing around it. behind that house is the solution for the flightless bird painting secret from leyndell, royal capital . check out our painting locations and solutions for more info. go to the northernmost section of the village to fight the godkin apostle . the fight can be challenging due to the uneven ground, so keep a medium distance between him. his second phase begins at 60% hp, where he will jump in the air and slam down to create a shockwave. at this stage, he'll gain the ability to use the skin of his armor to increase the distance of his attacks, making the fight even more difficult for melee-only builds. killing the godskin apostle will reward you with the scouring black flame incantation as well as the godskin peeler twinblade. millicent can be found here once you speak to her at lux ruins. following the direction of the windmill village site of grace will lead you to the northern capital gate camp, a heavily guarded outpost with multiple catapults and enemy ambushes. the catapults will bombard you as soon as you are within a particular point on the road, so be careful when riding towards the camp. you'll see their shots when you get closer to the golden seed tree. ride southeast closer to the capital outskirts wall to grab the ash of war - lightning slash from a nearby teardrop scarab. now move up towards the small plateau where the highway lookout tower is located. you'll want to go inside the tower as fast as possible because the leyndell soldiers are waiting to attack you from the bushes. jump up the destroyed ramparts on either side and climb up to loot the greatbow from inside the chest. this lone church on a steppe is located directly south of the sainted hero's grave entrance. you'll find tons of lightning rams roaming the nearby pasture. inside the church, you'll find a sacred tear below the statue—but be wary of the two enemies in each corner as soon as you enter. facing the entrance from underneath the statue, you'll see a chest on the left side of the church with the dragonbolt blessing incantation inside of it. as you explore this region, you may come across several scarabs scampering away. some of them will refill your flask of tears, but others can reward you with special items: reward: ash of war - sacred order if you arrive at the altus plateau using the lift after clearing the ruin-strewn precipice , you'll arrive at the abandoned coffins site of grace, and you can find a road leading northwest along a small lake to the perfumer's ruins. along the road is a scarab in plain sight you can attack. reward: ash of war - shield crash south of the erdtree-grazing hill in south altus plateau, you can find a large ruin on a hill swarming with demi-humans, around the back of the ruins on the north side, look around for a scarab to hunt down. reward: ash of war - blood blade at the erdtree-grazing hill overlooking much of the southern part of the altus plateau, you can spy a large shallow ravine to the north past an enemy camp lined with explosive barrels. the ravine leads north towards the shaded castle, and along the way you can find a scarab in the shallow waters, but giant crabs may jump out to ambush you. reward: ash of war - golden slam in the north central part of the altus plateau is a large misty valley that comprises the minor erdtree and woodfolk ruins, which is crawling with wormfaces. search for a small ruined area just to the northeast of the erdtree and you'll find a scarab inside the ruins surrounded by slugs and wormfaces - take it out fast! reward: protection of the erdtree incantation after crossing the forest-spanning greatbridge in the northern part of the altus plateau, you'll find a series of windmills, including one to the south, just to the east of the bridge along a road going under the bridge towards mt gelmir. along this road is a square section of ruin near the south windmill that has a golden scarab waiting on top for you to kill. reward: ash of war - lightning slash on the road up towards the northern entrance to the capital outskirts, you'll find several catapults trying to block your approach. on the hill at the top of these catapults to the north, you'll find an empty soldier camp with a scarab waiting for you near a lookout tower. reward: ash of war - lightning ram from the northern gate to the capital outskirts, look for a lower road to the south that leads along the high plateaus where lightning continually strikes before you find a large sword graveyard populated by electrified sheep and rams. among the sword graves you'll find a scarab here too. /n mount gelmir is one of the main regions in elden ring. this page includes an overview of the area, including all main dungeons, bosses, loot, and secrets to find in this region. mt. gelmir is one of the sub-regions of the altus plateau directly north of liurnia, and is a site of a lava-filled volcano with its own legacy dungeon. it can be reached through the road of iniquity in the northeastern part of the altus plateau, with another lower path heading through a treacherous canyon past wyndham ruins. the mountain is home to the crazed and frenzied remains of leyndell soldiers sent to attack the tarnished hunters who live in the volcano manor, a legacy dungeon of the region that is ruled over the praetor rykard , one of the shardbearer demigods who rejected the two fingers and the golden order in favor of lusting after a depraved sort of power, and lords over a group of recusants who hunt and kill other tarnished - and may even invite you to join their schemes. to reveal the details and topography of the whole altus plateau region, you'll need to find three map fragments at the steles located in the altus plateau proper, as well as mt gelmir and the capital outskirts. the mt gelmir map fragment is located deep within the region, requiring you to undertake twisting pathways and climb up the mountain to reach the volcano manor itself, where you'll find the map stele on a road below the manor leading to the large broken bridge - but beware the hands that guard it. mt gelmir's legacy dungeon is called the volcano manor , and it is the fourth (or possibly fifth) such main dungeon you will encounter naturally in elden ring. it is somewhat close in size to the academy of raya lucaria , and is hidden deep within the mountain at the base of the volcano that bears its namesake. it is ruled by a depraved demigod called praetor rykard, the blasphemer. unlike other dungeons, getting to the volcano manor is half the trouble - as you'll need to find the twisting paths and rope ladders to scale the mountains until you can finally reach the entrance. once inside, you'll find the real dungeon is hidden, and must either explore carefully or undertake missions for the lady of the house, tanith. completing all assassination missions will let you bypass the rest of the dungeon straight to the boss, or you can explore the prison town, torture chambers, and magma fields below the manor. when you're ready, see our volcano manor walkthrough to learn how to defeat the enemies within, and find every last item and secret inside. volcano manor bosses npcs godskin noble tanith, rya, bernahl, patches, diallos rykard, lord of blasphemy mt. gelmir

the edge of the cliffs. speak to him, and a cutscene plays in which patches pushes you over the ledge, saying you'll never reach the volcano manor . patches will also appear by the entrance to the manor once you pledge your allegiance to them, selling most of the same that he did in liurnia. once you've cleared the legacy dungeon, he'll pack up shop once more, and move east - right before the

you defeat rykard, she'll move to his chamber. rya - rya is found inside the large room of the volcano manor after you've pledged your allegiance through tanith. she will later reveal her true form in

information . diallos - diallos will move to the volcano manor after finding him at the academy gate town. he will be here until you've killed the legacy dungeon's main boss, prompting him to move to jarburg to seek his purpose. recusant bernahl - initially found in the warmaster's shack in west limgrave , knight bernahl's true identity is a tarnished hunter and member of the volcano manor. he sells various ashes of war in exchange for runes. his quests are tied to tanith questline . once the boss of this legacy dungeon is dead, he and the other inhabitants will leave, but his sword will

hierodas glintstone crown, starlight shards, prattling pate "you're beautiful", errant sorcerer armor set, memory stone, comet azur spell you can access these ruins by traveling to the erdtree-gazing hill site of grace by the lux ruins and riding north. many destroyed stone buildings are overgrown by plants, with some half-submerged under shallow water. several skeletons are guarding the surrounding area, so be sure to hit their dead body to kill them off completely. wyndham ruins is divided into two sections, one south where you can fight a tibia mariner field boss, and the other to the north on a separate plateau. the boss drops a deathroot and the tibia's summons sorcery. the abductor fields is an unmarked location that you can access by following the direction of the bridge of iniquity site of grace. a few virgin abductors are fighting off the leyndell knights in the area. there is not much to loot here, but you can climb a ladder west of the main path to get closer to the volcano manor's entrance. this shack is located right after the abductor fields, before the broken bridge that leads you to the volcano manor. several rotten strays are eating the flesh of rotten corpses around the area; try to clear them before approaching the shack to avoid fighting them and the npc invader anastasia at the same time. anastasia will drop her butcher knife and a furcalling finger remedy when killed. there is also the golden vow incantation you can pick up from the corpse inside the shack. from the ladder by the abductor fields, you'll soon find the leyndell soldier campsite to the north and the first mt. gelmir campsite site of grace to the south. there is no notable loot in the campsite except for the pulley bow you can find at the top of the siege tower. be wary of the leyndell soldiers guarding it; they can crowd and knock you off the platform if you're not careful. you can also find patches here by following the trail of rainbow stones if you're following his questline. the second campsite is located directly across the stone-pillar bridge after the first campsite. there will be a grafted scion guarding the surrounding area. kill it and grab the scavenger's curved sword from the corpse closest to the ladder. climbing the first ladder and then climbing the ladder to the left will lead you to the nomadic merchant. climb up, cross the bridge to the west, and hit the ninth mt. gelmir campsite site of grace. from the road of iniquity site of grace (underneath the entrance of the volcano manor), head down past the wormface, and you should soon see the burnt minor erdtree. there is a larval tear you can pick up from the corpse close to the wormface. as you get closer to the tree, it will trigger the ulcerated erdtree field boss fight. if you've fought other ulcerated erdtrees, this one also has the same moveset—it will drop the leaden hardtear and the cerulean hidden tear when killed. the latter is especially useful for sorcery and faith builds, as it removes all fp consumption for a short period. if you traverse the low canyon either up from the windham ruins or west from where patches kicks you off the mountain, you can make your way past the roving undead to find a large fort guarded by flame acolytes. among them are several bloodbriar witches that can either swing their flaming staffs around in wide arcs, or trigger briar spells that deal immense bleed damage in a line, but they are very weak to melee attacks. unfortunately you'll also have to dodge three different flame chariots that will burst out behind barricades - be sure to use torrent to race out of the way of their fires before striking the pilot in the back. off to the left side are several bloodbriar witches fighting of leyndell soldiers, and in the middle you can find a circle of them around a bonfire. off to the right is the entrance to the fort where two flame monks are fighting more lenydell soldiers, and further to the right is a small cemetery where docile spirit jellyfish roam around a body holding a stonesword key . inside the fort itself stands a lone guard - a powerful prelate of the fire monks that wields a mighty hammer and a strange helmet. he'll use the helmet to unleash a volcano of fire balls around himself, and will begin to pulse out around him at a steady pace as you fight. you'll want to choose your attacks carefully, as he can dash forward to swing his hammer around like a whirlwind that requires multiple blocks to survive, or he'll often use slow and heavy swings either from the side in 2 hit combos, or an overhead slam. he may even jump into the air for a ground slam, so be ready to back off and dodge it, then race in to hit him as he slowly gets up. the prelate's fire on his helmet will eventually go out, so use the opportunity to press the attack before it can start up again, and he'll drop the prelate's inferno crozier when defeated. check inside the fort to grab the armorer's cookbook 7 . be sure to explore the top of the fort, but the chest here is empty. instead, you'll see a mysterious message while searching the ramparts from a spirit that thinks they can't be found. in fact, this ghostly undead is hiding on a small scaffolding on the outer rampart ledge you need to jump over to find, and once near him, you can grab the fire scorpion charm he was hiding. the hermit's shack is located atop a small hill south of fort laeidd, just after the magma wyrm field boss fight. demi-humans and a family of bears now inhabit the shack, and as you move up the hill, a runebear will jump from the corner and attack you. try to get the runebear to attack the glowing statue to reveal the smithing stone 6 x3 inside. once you kill it, go inside the shack and grab the rolling magma sorcery from the corpse. continue up the hill from the hermit's shack until you see the craftman's shack to your right. there is a site of grace you can hit here, and the pulley crossbow you can loot from a corpse outside the shack. keep riding north, and you'll soon arrive at the hermit village. like the hermit's shack, the village is also overrun by a large group of demi-humans. behind a house on the southeastern end of the village is the hierodas glinstone crown you can loot from a corpse—there is also the prattling pate "you're beautiful" by the door of the adjacent house. that headpiece is part of the errant sorcerer set, which you can also find inside a nearby shack. as you travel to the end of the village, this will trigger the demi-human queen maggie field boss. the boss herself is relatively easy, but the battle can be hectic due to the pesky sorcerers that back her up from afar. when you finish the enemies off, interact with the primeval sorcerer azur to receive the comet azur sorcery—showcasing this spell to sellen will allow you to continue her questline. spoiler warning : tap to reveal . as you explore this region, you may come across several

the road into the town to find the scarab on a low rooftop just above the omenkiller in the courtyard lower down. reward: somber smithing stone 5 further into the volcano manor, after defeating the godskin noble, you'll have to ascend the volcano to a large magma pool with a bridge flanked by snake gargoyle statues. run along the cooled magma under this bridge to find a scarab to hunt down. /n volcano manor is a legacy dungeon you can encounter in the mt. gelmir area in elden ring. it contains many challenges and dangers, an extensive sidequest , as well as a demigod boss . this page will contain walkthrough and guide information on how to reach volcano manor, all the treasures and items that can be found inside, tips for navigating the dungeon, and how to defeat its fearsome bosses. how to get to volcano manor how to access the volcano manor dungeon volcano manor walkthrough prison town church guest hall godskin noble boss fight temple of eiglay rykard, lord of blasphemy boss fight if you read our guide to completing the academy of raya lucaria you may have seen our warning about the abductor virgins. getting killed by one of these enemies causes them to bring you to the volcano manor basement, and we will be using that event as a shortcut to get to the manor itself. once you get abducted and arrive in the basement of the manor, use our how to escape the aubductor's inquisition chamber to defeat the two virgin abductor bosses beyond the site of grace to get out and rest at the seethewater river site of grace. from here, we have a long ride to the manor which will take a past a number of nasty foes. go directly north from the site of grace, into the canyon path. as you ride keep an eye out for the golden seed on the left side of the path, and grab as much volcanic stone as you can as you ride through. just look out for the lava geysers that are scattered all over the ground. take the left path at the split and it should bring you directly to the seethewater terminus site of grace, which lies in the shadow of fort laiedd . ride up to the fort, but instead of going in ride south across the massive pool of lava. stick close to the left wall because a magma drake will spawn as you try to pass through. torrent will take damage from the lava as you ride so don't forget to drink a flask if you get low. stay to the left on the other side of the lava and you will ride between some cliffs and into a graveyard where you can get some golden rune if you like. keep following this path and you will pass by an enemy ambush that includes a powerful rune bear. as long as you keep sprinting none of them should be able to catch you, and you will be able to find the craftsman's shack site of grace just up ahead. our next bit of scenery is the hermit village . leave the shack and continue up the path and through the ramparts, being sure to avoid the abductor virgin on the left. ride through the village gates and straight between all the houses, only stopping to get items if you think its safe. on the opposite end of the tower you will see a boss waiting for you: demi-human queen maggie . ride directly past her and her crew of mages and grab the primeval sorcerer azur site of grace that is hiding just behind her. you can also speak to the sorcerer to get the comet azur spell. from here you are going to ride along the natural stone bridge next to the site of grace and leap down to the cliff on the other side. here you will find the gelmir hero's grave dungeon, feel free to pop inside and activate the site of grace here if you like. exit the hero's grave and continue your ride north. you will quickly come across another massive natural bridge, as well as some ramparts with a siege machine looking over them. climb into the siege machine if you want to loot the pulley bow inside, but otherwise ride over to the natural bridge and cross over to the other side. on the other side you will find a dilapidated camp at the foot of a cliffside, with a tall ladder strung up the side of it. as you approach the ladder a grafted scion will fall down to defend it. you may be able to bait it away from the ladder then run and climb it behind its back, but its much easier to just defeat it. keep in mind that most of its attacks are multi-hit combos that end with a powerful slam, so make sure you aren't attempting to attack or guard counter until the combo is over. any time the scion rears up on its back legs it is about to unleash a powerful attack, so get back and keep your shield raised. defeat it to claim its scavenger's curved sword as your reward. climb to the top of the ladder and you will immediately spot another ladder on the cliff wall to your left. climb this one and you will arrive at a small merchant's camp. he sells stonesword key , nomadic warrior's cookbook 20 , and a variety of armor and ammunition. buy anything you might need, then climb the ladder behind him to proceed. we are nearly at the top of the mountain, but we find ourselves in a precarious spot with soldiers all around. from the top of the ladder you should be able to see a sword monument on the hill ahead of you. climb onto torrent and ride directly for that monument, running and jumping past any nearby soldiers. look over the cliff behind the sword monument and you will see a wooden bridge and the ninth mt. gelmir campsite site of grace on the other side. jump down to the bridge, cross over, and rest at this site to reset the enemies. nearly there, i promise! but not before we encounter our most dangerous foe yet. climb onto torrent once more and use the nearby spiritspring to leap to the top of the mountain where you will immediately encounter a boss: the full-grown fallingstar beast . we do not want anything to do with him, so immediately turn yourself west and look for the long natural stone bridge that juts off of his mountain top. ride across and jump for your life to land on the mountain below. but you aren't out of danger yet! as soon as you land you will be set upon by a few marionette soldiers. keep riding down the hill and you will see another gold tree with a golden seed underneath. grab it then immediately look to your left where you will see the volcano manor in the distance. drink a flask to get your health back and ride straight for it. ignore the troll standing guard and run straight into the front door. congratulations, you made it! similar to the academy of raya lucaria, getting to volcano manor does not automatically grant you access to the dungeon within. first you will need to do a little talking to the head of the house, lady tanith. she will ask if you want to join the volcano manor in its mission against the erdtree. say yes, and she will hand over the drawing-room key , granting access to a few of the rooms within the manor. from here, you have a two different options to proceed. you can enter the drawing room and grab the letter from volcano manor off the table, beginning the assassination missions sidequest. there are three in total, and if you complete them all you will be able to jump straight to the boss of volcano manor, lord rykard . however, you will not have access to the final assassination target until after you complete leyndell, royal capital . for now you need to do the first two missions, being sure to speak to lady tanith and her servant girl between each quest. eventually she will reveal the location of the secret entrance to the dungeon, but if you don't want to do all that right now, feel free to skip directly to the walkthrough below. with the drawing-room key in hand you can access the rooms in the hallway of the volcano manor. open the first door on the right and you will find a small room with a dead body in the corner. this body is meant to serve as a hint to then location of the hidden entrance. loot the body to receive a perfume bottle , then roll into the wall with the red painting on it to dispel the illusory wall. the secret passageway behind is dark, so equip a lantern or torch to light the way as you walk through. there are a couple of weak snails guarding a budding horn x3 in the first large room. ignore the nearby staircase for now and exit out the doorway. run to the end of this hall, through the snail ambush, to find the nomadic warrior's cookbook 21 at the end. roll into the wall next to the item to reveal another illusory wall, then loot the body inside to get the depraved perfumer carmaan ashes. return to the staircase in the first room and go down to reach another large room with a bloodhound knight inside. sneak up on him and kill him to get the fireproof dried liver he is guarding. with the knight dead you can exit out the corner room and follow this hallway to reach the prison town church site of grace. exit the church via the door in the back and you will find yourself on a cliffside overlooking the mountain crater. to the left is a shortcut we can't access yet, so go right toward the village where you will encounter a man-serpent. these enemies seem to be a basic sword and shield type but you will quickly see they can stretch out their bodies to extend their range, and bite you to inflict poison. still, they can be backstabbed and guard countered fairly easily. next we will explore the town, staring with the rooftops. jump onto the roof the man-serpent was watching over and you will see another man-serpent stalking a roof ahead of you. kill him, then jump to the hexagonal roof nearby. below this you can see a roof with two weak enemies on it connected to another via a wooden bridge. drop down, kill the enemies, then grab the golden rune [5] on the bridge. look above and you will see an enemy throwing poison bombs down on you. ascend the nearby roofs and kill him, then the man-serpent who comes rushing down after him. go up to the next roof and look to the left where you will see a golden rune [9], then kill all of the enemies on this roof. it will make things easier when we drop to the ground later. from the spot where you found the golden rune [9], drop down to the roof below and look down and you will see an item on an awning below. drop down to grab the smithing stone [5]. from here we will finally drop down to the street. note the powerful omenkiller staring at the fire. crouch and drop down and you can get a backstab on him to start the fight, but be warned this may alert the dog patrolling the alleyway on the right as well. pay attention to when the dog turns around before engaging. as for the omenkiller, he will swing his cleavers around wildly but has no shield to defend. he is very susceptible to backstabs. just look out for this fire breath which leaves damaging flames on the ground, and his overhead slam (which he will execute three times in a row, roll away!). defeat him to claim his great omenkiller cleaver , then grab the drawstring fire grease and golden rune [6] from the bodies near the fire. ascend the stairs behind the fire and look for the open prison door, head inside to find the erdtree seal . next go back to the alleyway where we saw those dogs earlier. kill both of them and exit through the archway on the other side to arrive on a ledge that overlooks the lava. descend the wooden staircase that juts off the ledge and you will be able to see an item sitting on a crumbling wooden ledge below. if you get a running start this jump is barely doable. make sure you are at full health before you attempt it. if you make the jump a stonesword key is your reward and then you can jump to the hardened rock platform behind you. if you fail, you should land safely on those same rocks. either way, it's time to explore under the town! round the corner and you will find yourself looking at a graveyard with lava running through it. there are soldjars scattered around, some regular and some of the exploding variety. jump to the small island in the middle of the lava to get a smithing stone [6]. look for the large soldjar nearby and kill him to get the smoldering shield he is guarding, then hop up onto the ledge above him to get a golden rune [9]. once you're done looting the area look for the upward sloping path on the opposite side of the graveyard which will let you climb over some houses and back to the alleyway (just jump carefully or else you might end up in the lava below. you can teleport out of the lava and back to the prison church assuming you don't have any aggro). this time take a left and exit the town through the front gate. go up the stairs and you will see a stonesword key door, but ignore that for now we have to come back anyways. go up the stairs on your right instead where you will encounter an abductor. draw it down onto the platform by the stonesword key door to give yourself some extra room and try to bait out its grab so you can hit its weak point. remember to completely run away if it executes its spin attack! with the abductor dead you can ascend the stairs, grabbing the fire arrow x10 being guarded by the dog at the top. on the roof immediately to the right of the arrows is a scarab that drops a somber smithing stone [5]. keep ascending the stairs, kill the dog trying to ambush you, then look to the right and see a building with a hexagonal roof. climb this building and find a smithing stone [6] at the top. jump back down to the ground and keep following the path backwards. you will see an alleyway with three dogs on your left, kill them to get a furlcalling finger remedy . now that we have arrived back where we started its time to go back down the stairs and open up that stonesword key door, but beware! there is another abductor immediately inside. thankfully this one doesn't seem to aggro until you get close so you have time to prepare for the encounter. once it is dead, climb the stairs and kill the enemies on the platform overhead to claim the crimson amber medallion +1. exit this building and cross the nearby bridge, then kill the serpent guarding the door to this new building. the front door is locked, so go to the left and jump over the railing and onto the roof where you will find an albinauric bloodclot . jump the next railing where you will find the open side door. inside are a number of defenseless enemies, one of which is guarding a beast blood in one of the corners. once you've cleared the room you can approach the front door and unlock it to open the shortcut. exit the front door and check the opposite side of the house where you will see a ladder that goes up to the roof. around the corner is a serpent guarding a smithing stone [4]. go back to the ladder and get on the roof. go straight ahead and look down and you should see a ledge below. drop down and immediately crouch, then walk in the door. you should see an item on the table to the left, and an omenkiller in the corner. sneak up on him to get a backstab for an easy battle, then grab the items: the albinauric staff and albinauric mask . exit the room through the door on the right side which leads you to a ladder. climb up to find yourself on a balcony with a golden rune [10]. go back down the ladder and jump off the balcony to get back inside the building. descend the stairs here, looking out for the strange crawling creatures that rush toward you. if they grab you they will deal significant damage. there is a golden rune [9] under the bottom staircase, guarded by more enemies. head through the door near the bottom of the stairs where a hanging enemy will alert the room to your presence. get ready to be rushed by more crawling enemies. when the room is clear you can explore the area, finding the serpent and explosive greatbolt x5 on the balcony, and the guest hall site of grace in the small room. exit the site of grace room and look for the closed double doors nearby. open them and you can either drop from the ledge or use the ladder to your left to reach the area below. this area is mostly filled with weak slugs and solider enemies so feel free to kill them at your leisure or just ignore them entirely. go right as soon as you land and check around the side of the guest hall building to find some slugs guarding a fire dried liver . turn around go forward up the sloping path between the mountainside and building ahead of you. use this to get on top of the building where you can grab a somber smithing stone [6]. from up here you can see an altar in the lava below with a golden rune [9] on it. past the alter you will see a set of stairs on the right and a low hanging building on the left. get on top of the building, then jump to the long wall adjacent to it. run along the wall to reach a new roof with a golden rune [6] on it. go back to the stairs and go up them to reach the platform at the top where you will encounter a new man-serpent, this one wielding a whip. this enemy is more annoying than the sword variety due to their wild attacks and longer range. stay in shield until the lizard concludes its random swinging, or try and get a sneaky backstab. directly below this platform is a magma drake mini-boss. you can reach the area by taking the cage elevator behind the serpent, or just dropping down. this drake is stronger than the ones you have encountered before, made extra annoying because of the limited space. if you are going to try and battle it be sure to draw it onto one of the larder platforms to give yourself space to move around. the rewards for defeating this drake are incredibly lackluster ( dragon heart , smoldering butterfly x6, smithing stone 7, small amount of souls) so only bother if you really need the dragon heart. with that done take the lift back up to the serpent platform, then take the next cage elevator up to another platform high above. to the left is a staircase guarded by a perfumer, but go left first and grab the somber smithing stone [5] hanging off the cracked ledge. go back to the stairs and battle the perfumer. these guys have some powerful attacks and magic, but they leave themselves wide open after their slam attack or when casting a spell. look out for the black flame explosion spell, then strafe around the land a critical back stab. at the top of the stairs ignore the chapel and go left where you can pull the giant level to bring the bridge up, creating a shortcut back to the prison church site of grace. you're gonna need it because next up is... given the relative easiness of the final boss of volcano manor, the godskin noble might as well be the true boss of this area. he is a powerful foe who uses a mix of quick melee attacks and black fire magic, and his surprising speed lets him cover long distances quickly. it can be hard to figure out when you can possible get an attack in, especially when he enters his even more erratic second phase. first things first, you're going to want a 100% physical block shield, even better if it has the barricade shield ability. keep your shield up and keep an eye out for a few different attacks: circular swing into forward jab : this one is very obvious thanks to the exaggerated way he swings his sword in a circle for the first hit. block the circle swing, then guard counter the jab, or roll toward him then sneak in 1-2 attacks. hilt slam : this one is dangerous due to the high damage, but very punishable. he will raise the sword hilt above his head and lift his foot, before slamming the hilt into the ground. he almost always does two slams, so dodge roll into him at the moment of him impact to avoid the damage then get in an attack or counter. lunge and jab : he usually does this one if you are in the mid range. he does an exaggerated stutter-step to moev forward, then does one quick jab. block it and guard counter. backhand punch : probably his simplest move, the noble will slowly pull his arm back and twist his body, then swing at you with the back of his hand . block this for an easy guard counter. if he summons the ring of fire you want to roll out as quickly as possible. do not risk getting trapped inside with him as the flames can stagger you, opening you up to more attacks. also keep an eye out for his fireball attack. if you see him charging it up start moving forward. dodge the fireball as it soars toward you and you might be able to get in one attack as he's waving the fire from his hand. around half health he will float into the air and charge himself up with a fiery explosion before entering phase two, so back off to avoid the damage. from here he will almost always open with one of his new attacks by inflating his body, which will push you away, then either roll around the room like a wheel or slowly float into the air before slamming down. the float can be easily avoided by just backing off or dodging at the moment of the impact, but the roll is a little more complicated. your best bet is to try and weave between the pillars and hope he repeatedly bumps off of them and misses you, but you can also just follow his movements and dodge roll any time he gets close or block if you have enough stamina to hold up. in this phase he switches up his combos a little but you can mostly keep an eye out for the same attacks. another easily punishable attack at this point is his powerful forward thrust. he will telegraph this attack by raising his sword above his head, then pointing it forward and down. he will lunge forward powerfully, leaving himself wide open for a few seconds after. however, do not confuse this move with his rapid thrusts. before the rapid thrusts he will hold is sword vertically in front of himself for a moment, then let loose a flurry of thrusts which will easily break your guard then kill you. this is probably his most dangerous attack since you only have a moment to recognize it and react, but you will want to roll away or to the side as quickly as possible. as always be patient. wait for the right openings and keep yourself healthy as much as possible. wear the noble down with these strategies and you will be rewarded with his godskin stitcher and noble presence , the serpent's amnion key item, as well as a new site of grace, the temple of eiglay . left of the site of grace and altar you will see an elevator you can ride up to the upper level of the temple. run around the second floor and you will find a golden rune [9] in the back. next walk out onto the outdoor balcony and look down over the edge and you will see a rocky platform covered in more lava slugs. drop down, then look for the hidden path behind the nearby stake of marika which leads to a golden rune [12]. cross the thin river of lava and you will find a body with smoldering butterfly x4. go up the path and cross the natural bridge that is guarded by four lava slugs. you will find a furlcalling finger remedy on the other side, then down onto the rocks below where you can continue climbing up to the next level of the volcano. you find yourself looking at a lake of lava, with a set of large buildings to your right. cross over the lava and you will encounter another abductor. you can fight it, or just ignore it and jump through the open window behind it. you will find yourself in a large dark room with a broken floor. open the door to your right, then look toward the nearby ledge where you will notice a ladder peeking up over the edge. climb down the ladder where you will find a drawstring fire grease x4, and encounter some more of those crawler enemies as well as two mages. clear the room then check the prison at the bottom to find missionary's cookbook 6 go back up the ladder and through the door we opened earlier. here you will encounter a new special man-serpent with a fiery sword that can leave damaging flames on the ground. the basic strategy here remains the same but do not stand in the fiery remnants or you could get chain stunned into a quick death. go up the stairs behind the serpent and you will find yourself in another dark room full of crawlers. go through the door to the left of the entrance and you will find an elevator that goes back to the temple of eiglay, but you might notice something else as well: a hidden doorway in the elevator shaft, just below the top. run through the door as the elevator goes past and you will find a secret room with one weak soldier enemy and a stonesword key . exit this room through the open window to get back outside, then walk along the lava and around the corner to find an ash scarab that drops a somber smithing stone [5] when killed. behind you is another thin rock path that goes underneath some overhanging snake statues. walk along this path to find another hidden room that is full of basilisks, but beware the two serpent-men hiding in the lava waiting to ambush you. draw them out and kill them first, then carefully take on the basilisks. you will probably want to draw them out rather than try and fight them all in that small room. once you've killed them all you can grab the somber smithing stone [6] they were guarding. with all of those enemies out of the way make your way back to the window you came out of and you will see another doorway on the opposite side of the lava. this will lead you to a ledge with a ladder that brings you back up to the walkway above. here are a bunch of zombies whose heads explode into poison when killed, so be careful around them. there is also another serpent-man with a whip, but this time it is a fire whip making things even more dangerous. he will swing the whip around spreading lava pools everywhere, so just wait for him to get bored of that any approach you before fighting. once the enemies are all out of the way walk out onto the top of the aforementioned snake statues to find a commoner's headband . before we go through the door behind the whip serpent we need to make one last detour for an item. go back to the bridge where you encountered that serpent with the flaming sword then peek over the edge. you will see another secret ledge with an item on it below. drop down to grab the crimson tear scarab . behind the fire whip serpent is an entrance back into the manor. cross through the first room and open the door in the corner to reach what looks like the throne room. here you will see a bunch more of those poison zombies, kill them immediately when you walk in and you can grab the man-serpent ashes they were guarding. next turn your attention to the two serpent-men up the stairs, and the serpent mage in front of the throne. draw them out one by one and fight them at the bottom of the stairs, then you can ascend to the throne and kill the serpent mage. he has a lot of health, but is relatively nonthreatening as long as you get in his face and prevent him from casting any spells. just beware his slow head slam attack. killing him will get you the gelmir glintstone staff . through the door behind the throne is a teleporter to the boss, but we don't want to go just yet. instead take the stairs opposite the throne up to the back of the room where you will find a doorway leading to a stonesword key door. use your keys to open the door and head inside to find yourself at the top of a dark room. it seems like you need to jump across the hanging cages to reach the bottom of the room but that is bait! instead look over the ledge to the right of the door and you will see a platform lit up below you. drop down and enter the nearby door to get into a dark hallway occupied by some serpent-men. go up the stairs and out the door back into the dark room, where you can walk along what remains of the floor to reach the dagger talisman . from here drop down to the cage below, then again onto another broken floor with a mage and a rune arc . now you can drop down the rest of the cages and make your way to the bottom of the room. the bottom floor is absolutely riddled with those crawling enemies so be ready for an ambush upon landing. carefully kill all of them then you are free to explore the room. on one end, you will find a door that leads to a lit up room where you can loot the ash of war: royal knight's resolve . exit this room and follow the path all the way to the end and you will open up a shortcut back to the volcano manor lobby. return to the dark room and check the opposite side where you will find a seedbed curse , a key item you should show to dungeater . go through the nearby door and you will find yourself on a balcony overlooking the prison church area, guarded by another abductor. there is also a somber smithing stone [7] hanging over the edge. with that we have completed our exploration of the volcano manor. make your way back to the throne room and take the teleporter to the audience pathway site of grace. rykard, lord of blasphemy , is one of the major bosses and the leader of volcano manor. he seems to have been human once, but has since fused his body to the god-devouring serpent in hopes of devouring all the other gods. rykard is more of a fun fight than a challenging fight, similar to the storm king from demon's souls and yhorm the giant from dark souls iii. upon entering the boss chamber you will find a dead body holding the serpent hunter weapon. this weapon unleashes massive power when used against rykard, making this fight (mostly) a breeze. the first phase of this fight is against the god-devouring serpent. because of the serpent hunter's long range you don't need to get all that close to hit him, and you wouldn't want to anyways because of the magma. find a spot where your light attack can hit the snake's head, then put up your shield and start swinging. the light attack takes very little stamina, so you should be able to attack a long time without stopping. the only concerns in this phase are his grab, which he telegraphs by opening his mouth wide and roaring and his poison breath which he telegraphs by leaking poison smoke from his mouth. you shouldn't be very close to the snake anyways, so just back up a little more if you see either of these attacks coming. when the coast is clear move in again and keep attacking until phase one is over. in phase two rykard will reveal his true form and equip his disgusting sword. from here on rykard will execute a mix of sweeping sword attacks (which are easily dodged with well-timed rolls, note the pause between his slam and sweep attack), explosive spells (which you can see coming, run or roll away between attacks), and snake head jabs, all while inching towards you. thankfully the strategy from phase one works just as well here, as long as you mix in a few more dodges when the spells come raining down. with good luck you can actually damage rykard down and kill him before he can really cause any trouble, but the worst case scenario is when he summons the red magic cloud above himself which causes numerous homing spells to start chasing you down. this combination of attacks becomes very hard to dodge, and you're almost better off just dying and hoping it doesn't happen next time. if you do manage to survive the barrage he will raise his sword skyward and slam it down with one last powerful attack before the cloud dispels. but like i said, that is worst case scenario. follow the strategy from phase one: shield up, light attack spam. you will block almost all of his outgoing damage (especially if you have a shield with barricade), and only need to worry about taking a few seconds here or there to let your stamina refill. killing rykard will get you the remembrance of the blaspemous and rykard's great rune . activate the site of grace, and grab the eye surcoat off the nearby body. from here you can return to volcano manor and speak with lady tanith, completing the manor's chain quest (return to the boss room after speaking with her to see a disturbing final scene). /n nokstella, eternal city and

rise (the northern-most of the three towers) and at the top will be a waygate. interact with it to travel to ainsel river main, where you can activate the site of grace there. just before the site of grace is a miniature ranni doll in a coffin, alongside several silver firefly around the water stream that you can collect. continuing forward, you'll come across another malformed star in the distance to the right, and a few clayman warriors patrolling. there are dozens of dewkissed herba plants dotted amongst the various bushes here, as well as a couple of corpses on the left, one in the water holding a golden rune and the one on the stone floor to the left that holds human bone shard . there are also a couple of ghost glovewort (6) plants across the water from the malformed star, so if you take out the malformed star with ranged combat you can traverse the entire area and grab these things with ease. heading to the left, following the water stream, you'll find a corpse with a smithing stone (4) , and beyond that a giant miranda flower and 4 smaller miranda flowers, as well as a couple of clayman spearmen. they are guarding a corpse that holds a stonesword key , and tucked in the back right corner by the waterfall is another ghost glovewort (6) plant. backtracking to the structure the malformed star was protecting, tucked behind the left statue is a ghost glovewort (6) and (7) plants, as well as another (7) plant on the right-hand side once you enter and deal with the clayman sorcerer. move down the slope beyond the structure, and there are a number of formic rock deposits lining either side of the passageway, as well as two giant ants lingering on the ceiling. those being dealt with, you'll enter another room of bones and viscera, with multiple winged ants. there are two corpses you can sneak up to and loot; one holds a golden rune (10) and the other shield grease . defeating the two winged ants, head down the slope on the left to fight an armored ant, where you will want to get behind its shielded head to deal better damage to its body. continue down the tunnel past the armored ant to emerge on a ledge high above the room with the first malformed star. there will be two spellcasters here so be careful not to get caught or blown off the ledge by any of their spells; lure them back into the tunnel to be extra safe. curving round to the right, carefully follow the path and drop down to continue and you'll spot a chest sitting atop the structure to the left. carefully jump over and in the chest is the wing of astel sword. you can also take the higher path to loot the corpse that you will have seen after dealing with the spellcasters to gain a somber smithing stone (6) . head back up through the tunnel and turn left following the water down to arrive at another well-lit structure. grab the ghost glovewort (6) plant down by the grates, then take the steps up on the left to pass through into nokstella, eternal city. to the right of the site of grace is a swordstress riding a giant ant, patrolling the water near a ghost glovewort (7) plant. heading up the stairs on the left, turn left after the first flight and fight the swordstress in the small building, and to the right you'll find a chest that contains the ant's skull plate shield. up the next flight of steps will be another swordstress and a number of electrified silver tears. curve around to the left to find another small room filled with four shielded silver tears guarding a chest containing a ghost-glovewort picker's bell bearing (2) . backing out of this room, turn left and loop around the side of the building, following the path to find a corpse at the dead end that holds the archer ashes . progress along the arched corridor and as you grab the golden rune (10) off the corpse hanging from the ledge on the right, a silver tear will drop from the ceiling and temporarily absorb you. halfway down the corridor you can enter an opening on the left, which upon entering a silver tear will drop from the ceiling and try to absorb you. the chest in this room holds a somber smithing stone (7) . at the end of the corridor is a corpse holding another golden rune (10). passing up the stairs on the left you'll note across the large bridge to the right is a living boulder that will roll down towards you, and like the one in nokron, killing it will grant you a larval tear. loop around the back end of the building to your left to find an imp seal, behind which are two swordstresses and a chest that holds the nightmaiden & swordstress puppets ashes. progress through the western opening and up the stairs to reach a room with two visible silver tears and a swordstress. these silver tears will transform into warriors, one with a greatsword and the other a shield and spear. you can draw them out one at a time with ranged attacks, which is advised as to prevent you getting overwhelmed as they are incredibly aggressive. once they and the swordstress have been dealt with, the chest behind them contains the moon of nokstella . curve around the right side of this giant throne to grab a nascent butterfly . on the left side of the room, walk through the passageway and head down the slope to a lift. ride the lift down and in front of you, you will see a golden seed tree. from here it is recommended to fast travel back to the nokstella, eternal city site of grace. in the ruins to the north is a corpse with drawstring holy grease , and another with a smithing stone (6) . swordstresses will be nearby, so be careful. in an alcove just beyond the ruins are three snails defending a corpse holding a celestial dew . if you follow the water downstream you'll come to a number of silver tears, more snails on the right lining the building, and a swordstress on an ant. many of these silver tears are electrified, and once defeated with explode with a small aoe electric sphere. these can start a chain reaction, so use that to your advantage to deal with a number of silver tears and the swordstress and ant without too much of a fight. on the left by the grates you'll find a ghost glovewort (8) , and near the rocks on the right is a corpse with a golden rune (10) . continuing northwest, dealing with the projectile firing silver tears on the ridge (that require getting behind to bypass their shield), there will be more electrified silver tears and three giant ants on the right alongside a number of formic rock deposits. just beyond the ants, to the northwest, is a corpse that holds a stonesword key . you'll come upon a stone structure with blue flames to the left, but first head past it to an arched structure near the waterfall to face a group of silver tears. the corpse they are guarding holds a celestial dew . by entering the stone structure on the left of the water stream (pictured above), you can ride a lift down to a new site of grace that is beneath the waterfall of the arena you found the dragonkin soldier of nokstella in. tucked to the left you'll find a ghost glovewort (9) plant, and through the tunnel to the south you'll find three basilisks guarding two corpses holding a smithing stone (4) and (5) respectively. at the end of the tunnel, it will open out into a red-tinged chamber where a red spirit of blaidd will spawn as a baleful shadow. ranni will speak to you, having previously tasked you with defeating these baleful shadows after repeatedly talking to the miniature ranni doll at a site of grace, and upon defeating blaidd (who can inflict bleed and use their own crimson tear flasks), ranni will thank you and you'll receive the discarded palace key . head up the steps to the right and ride the lift down to arrive at the lake of rot shoreside site of grace. down the slope to the right is a corpse that holds the map: lake of rot . an initially daunting area, the entirety of this zone inflicts the scarlet rot status effect, which once the bar is maximized, will deplete your health, and far faster than regular poison. the best strategy upon first arrival is to spend as many of your runes as possible and keep your health flasks stocked. though preserving boluses can alleviate scarlet rot, on your first journey across this space you'll essentially be wasting resources by using them. sprint southwest to the closest pillar. on that platform is a pressure plate, and will raise a section of pathway to make future traversal easier. continue doing so heading south/southwest, running from pillar to pillar activating the pressure plates and topping up your depleting health when necessary. when you reach the giant stone structure built into the cliff face on the south wall, descend down the steps on the left-hand side through the main doors to reach a site of grace. with this, you can teleport between different sides of the lake of rot with ease, and alleviate your scarlet rot infliction. from there, head back up the stairs and sprint to the west, where you'll see a smaller stone structure, inside of which is a chest that contains the nomadic warrior's cookbook 22 . back at the site of grace within the structure, descend the steps then jump across on the right to the destroyed ledge. cross the gaps and round the back is a corpse with a golden rune (10) . heading back to the other side, drop down through the gap and on the lower level is a golden centipede . continuing to drop down, as you reach ground level you'll encounter a number of lesser kindred of rot. you can choose to either face them or run past them, and up the steps in the building to the west is a chest containing scorpion's stinger weapon. back down the steps, turn right and sprint to the coffin at the edge in the center of the waterfall and interact with it to be teleported to a secret boss. a hyper aggressive malformed star, astel will likely take a number of attempts due to the sheer ferocity of its attacks, and the variety of moves it can perform. entering the arena through the mist wall, astel will likely open the fight with a giant beam that it summons between its mandibles. this attack, like many others that astel uses, requires slightly delayed reactions to avoid. for example, this beam is built up as astel rears its head backwards, then angles it down to target you, and you'll need to wait a second or so with astel in that state to dodge it as it fires. astel uses its tail like a scorpion, swiping from over its head, performing two slam attacks. astel slightly raises into the air as it prepares for the slams, and like the beam, you'll need to dodge later than you'd expect, once astel has landed again to sync up with the tail coming down. the majority of astels attacks revolve around the use of gravitational energy; summoning purple spheres with cosmic-looking trails to it. these are either in the form of swipes with its hands, leaving a vapour trail behind it that explodes after a short delay. if caught in this vapour trail, you'll have enough time to escape if you roll in the appropriate direction out of the path of the trail. because, particularly if you're a melee character, you'll be spending most of your time underneath astel's abdomen, it has a number of punishing attacks if you get too greedy. these play out as either astel summoning these purple spheres in its hands and slamming them into the ground, sending out pulsing waves of energy that will knock you down should they hit you. you can roll through each of these waves, but that requires pinpoint timing to try not to panic if you're beneath astel and you see it preparing an attack. another is astel creating a gravity well in a circle around itself, which you'll notice by small rocks beginning to float in that vicinity. after a few seconds, everything in that circle will begin levitating before astel slams it back down to the ground. this can be an insta-kill move, so sprint from the radius and begin running back in the second the slam hits the ground. astel also has some mandible attacks that occur if you linger in front of it; one regular two-move bite, and a super-charged variant that is signalled by blue energy lining its mandibles. if caught by this, astel will raise you into the air, and almost always acts as an insta-kill as it slams you back into the floor. if astel hunches over and a sphere begins appearing and pulsing above its body, it is about to teleport away to a different section of the arena. as it does so however, the sphere will explode outwards, so sprint away as it begins to do this. you will also want to keep your head on a swivel for where it spawns, because if you don't immediately see a new sphere signalling astel's arrival, it's about to perform an arena-wide lunge attack from above that, if caught in its mandibles, results in an instant kill. roll at the last moment towards astel if it does this to avoid the move connecting. at around 50% health, astel can rear its head back as cosmic portals appear behind it. as the portals begin pulsing, they will repeatedly fire comets at you, raining down for a few seconds. no amount of range will protect you from these comets targeting you, so you'll need to roll for your life as the comets begin emerging from the portals. upon defeating astel, naturalborn of the void, you'll earn the remembrance of the naturalborn . should you have obtained the dark moon ring by using the key from defeating the baleful shadow on the chest next to rennala in raya lucaria, the north end of the arena will be unlocked for you to traverse. head up the slope and ride the lift up to arrive at the moonlight altar. heading up to the cathedral of manus celes, you'll need to defeat glintstone dragon adula . upon defeating adula, you'll earn dragon heart x3 and adula's moonblade weapon. then head inside the cathedral, activate the site of grace then drop down through the hole in the floor from platform to platform on the right-hand side. then proceed through the tunnel to reach ranni who has slain an instance of the two fingers with the fingerslayer blade you provided. interact with ranni to place the dark moon ring on her finger, it will fully free her from her bindings. she will thank you and claim to meet you again at the end. you'll then receive the dark moon greatsword . /n deeproot depths is a larger underground region and hybrid dungeon found in the leyndell region in elden ring. it is an optional underground area slightly more linear than the overworld, but keeps many of its core mechanics - such as fast travel and the restoration of flasks upon defeating enemy groups persist whilst underground. this page contains information on the location, walkthrough, and guide to traverse this area, locate all of its treasure,

deeproot depths is technically accessible via two locations. one, a teleporter; the other is a coffin you can ride up a waterfall after you defeat the valiant gargoyles in nokron, eternal city . this guide starts from the coffin ride. after defeating the gargoyles. head to the very back of the arena against the waterfall and you'll note a coffin you can rest in. by interacting with it, you will initiate a cutscene riding the coffin up the waterfall and you'll emerge in deeprot depths next to a site of grace. from the site of grace, head southwest and you can platform with torrent up the tree roots to reach a corpse facing east holding a smithing stone (6) . to the southeast, you'll note an erdtree avatar patrolling. defeat it to earn the staff of the avatar , beyond which is a scarab that holds the ash of war: golden land . now head northwest past the tree roots to find a slope and a branch that is guarded by two winged ants. before continuing, you'll see a branch leading up into the rock face, with a small entrance. heading inside, through a small tunnel, you'll emerge into a cave filled with ants and ant queens. whilst the regular ants will be instantly hostile upon detecting you, it's your choice whether you kill the ant queens or not. however, each one you kill nets you a numen's rune and a rune arc . and there are four queens in this tunnel. when you drop down by the three queens, a corpse to the right holds a somber smithing stone (6) . continuing to the end of the cave, defeating any remaining ants, you'll find a corpse holding the elden stars incantation. drop down from here onto the platform with two winged ants. from there, continue along the branch up to the west to find a corpse holding a smithing stone (4) . moving southwest, you'll see 7 winged ants; 6 hovering in the air and one on the ground to your right, but if you head left (to the southeast) you can head along a small piece of wood to reach a corpse holding a golden rune (4) . after clearing the winged ants, you'll see three corpses in the clearing that they were hovering above; one holds a warming stone x3 , one holds a smithing stone (4) , and the third holds a golden rune (6) . continue all the way up to the west to reach a cliff edge with a finger reader crone and a site of grace. from the site of grace, head northeast along the path near the rim of the waterfall to find a small ruin on the right amongst the trees, full of basilisks. they are guarding two corpses, one with a rune arc and one with smithing stone (6) x3 . there are various corpses strewn along the path, some with smithing stones , others with hefty beast bones and one specifically in the center of this ruined town on the steps of the circular structure that holds the map: deeproot depths . from this structure, head northeast in through the open doors to defeat a fire-breathing enemy guarding the ash of war: vacuum slice . back outside, head east to the waterfall behind the ruined church to find a cave with a runebear. by defeating the runebear you'll earn the prince of death's cyst . then head southwest through all the ruins to emerge on the other side near a site of grace. from this site of grace, head west into the ruins amongst the water to find corpses among the coffins that are holding human bone shard x5 , smithing stone (4) x2 , clarifying boluses , golden rune (9) , golden rune (8) x2 , and a nascent butterfly . there is also a ghost glovewort (5) next to the tree nearby. to the southwest, on the edge of the waterfall, is another coffin that you can rest in that will take you to ainsel river main if you wish. heading north, you'll note a walking mausoleum in the distance, guarded by patrolling mausoleum soldiers. tucked in a cave across the water from the large cathedral-type building near the walking mausoleum, you'll find another runebear. defeat it to loot the three corpses it was defending to gain a somber smithing stone (7) , a golden rune (8) , and fan daggers x4 . to lower the mausoleum, you'll want to platform up the tree branches to the southwest and then clear the skull clusters around the rim of the mausoleums building. to the extreme north, next to a decayed tree stump are the mausoleum soldiers ashes . head southwest through and past the thicket of tree roots and branches to reach a small clearing leading to a giant tree, where an optional field boss, crucible knight siluria resides. should you defeat them, you'll earn the siluria's tree spear. inside the chest within the tree that siluria was defending is the crucible tree helm , the crucible tree armor , the crucible gauntlets , and the crucible greaves . looking east from the tree, you'll see a building, with a spirit spring down and to the right. use the spirit spring to launch onto this roof of the building next to the spring to loot a corpse holding a stonesword key . backtrack to the ruined town, by the last site of grace you activated, and platform up the branches (with or without torrent), and you'll see a number of the large fire-breathing enemies lining the roofs high above. curving up the branch to the left, you'll need to dodge the flames coming from the enemy above, and in the roof of the building to the left is a corpse holding the prince of death's staff . dropping off the branch onto a roof below on the left, grab the arteria leaf x5 off the corpse there and follow the branches back up. now following the branch up to the right, you'll encounter two more fire-breathing enemies above you. it's recommended to follow the branch to the right past both of them, then jump back across on the roof with one of them, and you can then safely take both of them out. before crossing the branch to the northeast and progressing into the next area, continue up the branch to the southeast, and similarly jump back to the northwest to see another fire-breathing enemy on the level above the last two you just dealt with. on the outer corner of that roof is a corpse holding nascent butterfly x3 . now turn to the northeast and you'll see below you, across a last bit of branch, is a site of grace and an archway through thick tree roots on the left. proceed all the way across this large open space, and as you approach the giant corpse on the far side a boss encounter will begin, so long as you have progressed far enough in fia's questline . a boss fight consisting of three waves against spectral opponents, this fight is unique but if you are appropriately leveled, it is unlikely to cause too much annoyance. the first wave is a single opponent, which can be any of the spectral invaders in the game. the moveset you'll be working against therefore shifts depending on which enemy it is that spawns in. if you're wanting to use a spirit ash, now is a good time to summon it in, as you'll have less opportunity later on when it may actually prove more useful. after clearing the first invader, the second wave begins; another singular invader. again clear this one and the third wave begins. the third wave is where things can get difficult; three invaders spawn in at once. your spirit ash, should you have summoned it earlier, will help to draw some aggro off of you from at least one of the opponents. if one of the invaders is a magic user, target them first to ensure no ranged attacks can take you by surprise when performing the dance of battle against the melee-focused spirits. when all three spirits are down, the fight will conclude with you earning the fia's mist sorcery, and a site of grace spawning near the large corpse; you'll also note fia sitting directly beneath the corpse, waiting for you. approaching fia and speaking to her, tell her you wish to be held, and give her the cursemark of death when prompted, and then exhaust her dialogue. when she begins repeating herself, back out and rest at the site of grace behind you, then go back to fia to find her seemingly resting. touch her and you'll be prompted to enter the deathbed dream. do so to initiate another boss fight! a large dragon enemy, lichdragon fortissax relies on swipe attacks with its claws and heavily damaging electrical moves. fortissax can perform similar move variations to other dragons, be it breathing fire, forward lunges, 180-degree tailspins, and flights into the air before slamming back down into the ground. fortissax will begin the fight however by summoning down multiple small lightning strikes that leave behind clouds of death inflicting vapor. this makes it instantly more difficult to traverse the arena safely, so it's recommended to use this time while fortissax is in the animation to summon an upgraded spirit ash to draw some fire and get in some extra damage. typically you can stick to just behind fortissaxs legs and repeatedly attack there to try and stagger the dragon. the only real attack to look out for here is foot stomps, which can be easily dodge-rolled away from. fortissax can also slam rods of electricity into the ground in front of itself, creating a large shockwave that radiates out across the majority of the arena. these can be deadly, dangerous even if they only briefly incapacitate or stagger you, so keep an eye out for these rods being summoned in fortissax's hands. it's arguably best to not lock on to fortissax as you are either directed to the head or chest, which are both relatively difficult to reach for melee builds, so keep your head on a swivel each time you go in for an attack. after whittling down fortissax's health and defeating the dragon, you'll earn the remembrance of the lichdragon . you can then return to fia's body and collect the mending rune of the death-prince , which is an item you'll need to achieve one of elden ring's alternate endings. /n capital outskirts is a sub-region in elden ring. this page includes an overview of the area, including all dungeons, bosses, loot, and secrets to find in this sub-region. capital outskirts is one of the sub-regions of the altus plateau and is located just outside of leyndell, royal capital . it can be reached by moving east on the altus highway or by riding southeast on the road of iniquity, past the windmill village. aptly named for the area inside of the capital's outer wall, the capital outskirts is heavily patrolled by leyndell soldiers guarding the entrances to leyndell, a legacy dungeon of the region that is ruled by morgott, the omen king , one of the shardbearer demigods who was born of the golden lineage. to reveal the details and topography of the whole altus plateau region, you'll need to find three map fragments at the steles located in the altus plateau proper, mt gelmir, and the capital outskirts. the capital outskirts map fragment is located right after the southern capital gate, past the two tree sentinels. the map stele can be seen next to the outer wall phantom tree site of grace on the main road leading to leyndell, royal capital. the altus plateau's legacy dungeon is called leyndell, royal capital , a vast city that used to be the home of many. after the shattering occurred, the people of leyndell have mostly perished—except for their demigod lord, morgott, the omen king. to enter the dungeon, you'll have to fight your way past the army of leyndell and into the northeastern section of the region. it is highly recommended that you withhold your adventure there until you explore more of the altus plateau, level up, find new items and rewards. you could even venture out west to mt. gelmir and clear the volcano manor first, as the enemy in leyndell is more challenging than those on the mountain. when you are ready, view our leyndell, royal capital walkthrough to learn how to defeat its many enemies and find every secret

the southern, the one guarded by the [[tree sentinel] duo. hit the site of grace and grab the golden seed x2 from under the tree; there is also the map fragment of the sub-region nearby. head south of the site of grace until you find the unmarked soldier camp. a lesser ulcerated tree spirit guards the area—kill it, and it'll drop another golden seed. be sure to grab the giant crusher colossal weapon from inside the wagon's chest. from the unmarked soldier camp, go back to the main road and ride south until you get to the minor erdtree church. hit the site of grace and grab the missionary's cookbook 4 from inside the church. go outside to the southeastern side of the church; you should be able to find the golden order seal from the base of the minor erdtree. ride directly east of the outer wall phantom tree site of grace until you see the broken rock bridge that divides the moat below. jump down, and you should immediately see the footsteps of the invisible teardrop scarab running around the water. the best way to approach the scarab is to stand by the tunnel and wait for it there. the tunnel is small enough for melee users to hit the scarab without it running away. you can find the sealed capital gate by following the main road to the capital north from the outer wall phantom tree site of grace. the first long stairs will be guarded by a gargoyle that'll spawn as soon as you get on the second set of stairs. it is highly recommended not to fight this mini-boss on horseback due to the sloped terrain. the gargoyle drops the gargoyle's axe upon defeat. keep moving north until you find another phantom tree; pick up the golden seed x2 from underneath it. move past the finger reader crone and up the stairs to the gate; there are two ashes of war you can loot nearby. the first one is the ash of war - golden parry from a teardrop scarab hanging from a ledge to the left of the stairs. the second is a lost ashes of war at the foot of the sealed gate, guarded by leyndell knights and soldiers. the outer wall battleground can either be reached north from the second phantom tree or south from the northern outskirt entrance. not much to say about this unmarked location outside of margit, the fell omen mini-boss. he has the same moveset as the one you find in stormveil castle and will not spawn again once defeated. he drops the viridian amber medallion +1 when killed. assuming you're entering the capital outskirts from the northern gate, immediately go left and up the main path towards the upper plateau—you should be able to see the hermit merchant's shack on your west. as previously mentioned, the shack is home to the hermit merchant. he notably sells the sentry's torch and the prophet set, amongst other goods. at night, the hermit merchant will disappear and be replaced by the bell bearing hunter—he will not spawn at night until you defeat this field boss. rest at the site of grace and pass the time until night. go up the road to the left of the hermit merchant's shack and get ready for another field boss fight—the deathbird —it drops the twinbird kite shield upon defeat. the boss is also guarding the winged crystal tear on a nearby altar that's surrounded by skeletons. the minor erdtree of capital outskirts does not contain an erdtree avatar or other bosses. instead, it is guarded by a group of commoners that an omen leads. you'll find the twiggy cracked tear and the crimson crystal tear on the tree's base. you can either ride down the main path or drop down the spiritspring to the south to reach the northern moat. the moat is home to several crabs, giant crabs, bears, and a runebear. though this is blackguard's second location, not following his questline will not make him move here from liurnia. in addition, once you've entered the legacy dungeon and found the dung eater underneath leyndell, you can find him again here in the northern moat as an npc invader. he will drop the sword of milos upon defeat. /n leyndell, royal capital is a legacy dungeon you can encounter in the altus plateau area in elden ring. it is a massive, labyrinthine city with powerful enemies, multiple bosses, and many treasures. this page will contain walkthrough and guide information on how to reach leyndell, all the treasures and items that can be found inside, tips for navigating the dungeon, and how to defeat its fearsome bosses. how to get to leyndell, royal capital draconic tree sentinel boss fight leyndell, royal capital walkthrough avenue balcony west capital rampart godfrey, first elden lord boss fight erdtree sanctuary morgott, the omen king boss fight ready for another long, dangerous ride? good! because it's time to set off for the capital. we will be starting from the road of iniquity site of grace located near the volcano manor . ride east toward the minor erdtree , past the boss and onto the broken bridge behind it. leap from the bridge and land on the lower half below. go straight past the corpse-stench shack and continue your ride east down the path. you will pass through a bunch of ramparts and a group of abductors. ignore them and continue riding until you see a wooden bridge and the bridge of iniquity site of grace. cross over the wooden bridge and you will find yourself on the altus plateau . here you will start to encounter some stronger enemies, including wolves, mages, and capital knights. just stick to the path, continuing to follow it as it begins to bend toward the northeast. when you reach the bridge you will want to make a slight deviation to find the road of iniquity side path site of grace under the arch of the large bridge. get back on the path and keep riding eastward. up the hill you will encounter a bunch of windmills and the path will begin to splinter in a few different direction. ride up the hill and you will find dominula, windmill village where you can rest at the windmill village site of grace. from dominula look southeast and you will be able to see the path that leads directly into the capital outskirts. ride up the path and toward the capital wall, but beware the turrets that fire massive arrows at anyone who approaches (there is also a golden seed on top of a rock to the right of the path, make a quick stop to grab it as you pass by). strafe left to right to avoid the arrows and you will be able to ride through the archway and into the outskirts. once inside you should see the outer wall battleground site of grace nearby. you will notice this site of grace does not point toward the front gates of the capital, because the front door is locked. still, i recommend riding down to the front gates where you will find two golden seed . if you take the time to go up the stairs to the front gate you can find a lost ashes of war . but that's not all! nearby you will see a giant staircase that leads down the hill. do not ride directly down the stairs or you will be attacked by a gargoyle. instead ride down the grassy hill to the left of the stairs. when you arrive at the bottom you will find two more golden seeds , the map: leyndell, royal capital , and the outer wall phantom tree site of grace. teleport back to the outer wall battleground site of grace and follow the guidance of grace to the northeast where you will see a staircase leading up the cliffside. it should be able to see the path forward now that you have the map, so follow it to the end where you will encounter one final obstacle between you and the capital... the draconic tree sentinel is the final test of whether or not you are ready to enter the capital, but thankfully he isn't too hard with the right approach. you are going to want to battle him almost entirely on horseback. this lets you take swipes at him as you pass by without ever having to stay within his attack range for too long. he will take swings back at you with his mace and also with his shield, so be sure to sprint out of the way anytime you see him winding up. don't get greedy: only one or two attacks per pass. if you get too far away he will shoot fireballs at you, so try to stay relatively close to him at all times. if you get enough attacks in over a short period of time you can stagger him momentarily, opening him up to a bunch of free attacks while he is down. he is susceptible to bleed which can speed up this fight dramatically, and remember to drink a flask if torrent takes any hits. you do not want to get grounded in this battle at all. at about half health the sentinel will power himself up with dragon magic, adding some new moves to his repertoire including two different lightning strike attacks. the first he will come to a stop and start charging up a spell before unleashing a flurry of lightning strikes in the area around him. this you can avoid by simply backing away and waiting for it to subside. the second he will point his shield to the sky and then summon a powerful lightning strike directly on top of you. this one is a bit trickier to avoid, dash around and you should be able to avoid the hits. other than that, the same strategy rings true. continue your hit and run strategy, never giving him too many chances to strike you. defeat him and you will be rewarded with the dragon greatclaw and dragonclaw shield . enter the doorway behind the sentinel to reach the capital rampart site of grace, and the entrance to leyndell, royal capital. head into the capital using the door at the end of the rampart, follow the path through until you reach the elevator at the end. go down the hallway at the top where you can find magic grease x3, then proceed down the hallway and into the chapel. grab the furlcalling finger remedy off the altar, then exit the chapel using the stairs on the other side to reach the outer walls of the castle. walk past the sleeping soldiers and up to the sandy overhang, where you can go right to find the east capital rampart site of grace. from here you can get out onto the castle wall by heading down the stairs. here you will encounter a pretty pathetic enemy, the trumpeting oracle envoys. these guys fire slow moving projectiles at you slowly roll around, but you can basically just run at them and kill them with no worries, even the large one on the center platform of the wall. check behind the larger envoy to find a golden rune [10]. exit the large envoy's platform using the stairs on the far side and look to the left where you will see another staircase that leads to a small room under the platform. here you will encounter one of those crossbow perfumers (beware the exploding bolts, as always) and a smithing stone [4]. exit out the other side of the room and you will be on a balcony that runs along the side of the rampart. follow it down where you will encounter four more envoys and another door. inside you will encounter yet another perfumer, and you can find cave moss x10 behind some furniture in the corner. through the nearby door is an elevator down into the capital, but we don't want to go there just yet. head upstairs to find a path back to the main rampart that gets you behind the giant perfumer beast that was guarding the way. in front of him is a golden rune [7]. rather than taking the elevator we are doing to head back to that balcony where we encountered the four envoys. look down over the balcony and you will see a golden rooftop below. drop down onto it, but beware the imp hanging from the wall who will attempt to ambush you. jump forward two rooftops from where you landed, then go diagonal one where you will run into two more imps. there are imps all over the rooftops, and they are surprisingly good at parkour, so be wary of them chasing you around or catching you off guard. from here drop down to rooftop below, where there is a golden rune [9] hanging off one of the windows. from this rooftop face yourself northeast and you should see another item on a rooftop three houses away. make careful jumps across the gaps (and deal with the imps along the way) to reach that item, a golden rune [12]. from this rooftop point yourself west and head toward the roof in the distance with two more imps and another item on it, this one a stonesword key . next up, face southeast and look down into the gap between the two buildings in front of you where you should see an item leaned up against a flower bed, a smithing stone [6]. walk down this alley and you will encounter a leynell knight at the end. these knights charge up their weapon with electricity to deal damage through your defenses, and can even call lightning bolts down from the sky for surprise attacks. get the jump on him with a quick backstab, then check the alleyway to the left of the building he was guarding where you will find a golden rune [9]. go back to the spot where you found the smithing stone next to the flower bed. you can use the flower bed to hop back up to the rooftop above you. face northwest and you will see one of those giant metal caravans the trolls are usually dragging around the overworld. drop down next to the caravan and you will find a golden rune [9] nearby. but look out! there is an edtree avatar that walks up and down this street that will attack you if you step into its line of sight. it is easiest to just deal with it now, so get ready for a tough battle. erdtree avatars are powerful, but all of their melee attacks are slow and incredibly telegraphed. its overhead swings and foot stomp can be easily avoided by dodging in before the moment of impact, and many of the horizontal swings you can dodge with a strafe or sideways roll. all of these are then punishable with 1-2 attacks before you want to get back into defensive position. the attacks to be afraid of are the magic slam, in which the avatar glows and leans forward before leaping into the air and slamming down with a big area attack. when you see it charging you just need to back off, wait out the slam, then rush in and punish with a dash attack or jump attack. then there is the dangerous homing spell, where the avatar smashes the head of its staff into the ground in front of itself, summoning about a dozen magic bolts. you can avoid these by running in a circle around the avatar, but it may try and hit you while the spells are active so make sure you are prepared to dodge its melee attacks as well. all in all it is a battle of patience and waiting for the right openings. do not rush anything, especially not when the magic spells are in play. defeat the avatar to get a lord's rune , and make the streets a little bit safer. look around and you will see an item sitting on a set of stairs off to the side of the street, which is a gold firefly x3. almost directly across the street from that is an overturned caravan which you can jump on top of using the flower bed behind it. on top is a holy grease . keep heading southwest down this street and you will see a set of doors open on the right. go through them to find the avenue balcony site of grace. rest here if you need to refresh your flasks, but we have a lot more exploring to do in the previous area. head back up to the street. this time we are going to follow the street east, past the caravans and all the way to the closed door at the end. open the door to find an ash covered area on the other side. go straight ahead where you will see a single misbegotten stalking around. kill it, then look right where you will see two more misbegottens chopping up something on the ground. defeat them to claim the beast blood x3 they were guarding. behind the enemies is a railing that overlooks a pond. follow along the railing, keeping an eye on the debris on your left. you will see two dogs guarding an item. defeat them to claim a golden rune [9]. just past the dogs is another wrecked caravan with some dogs and a misbegotten behind it, as well as a lightningproof dried liver . at the end of this path you will come across one of the more powerful leonine misbegottens, as well as a large dog. do not approach. let the leonine notice you and he should approach without also aggroing the dog. remember that almost all of the leonine's attacks bounce off of a shield with the barricade shield ability, so if you have the great turtle shell equip it here to totally ruin this guy with guard counters. defeat the leonine and then the dog, which allows you to claim the perfume bottle they were guarding. retrace your steps back to the base of the giant staircase near where you killed those first few misbegottens. climb of the first set of stairs, but then break away and climb up onto the dirt mound that is spilling over into the staircase. at the top you will encounter a few more misbegottens sleeping in some bushes, including a larger one with a giant axe. these guys are strong, bit their attacks are incredibly slow and obvious. you can mostly just strafe around them and get safe back attacks. kill them to safely claim the soporific grease x2 nearby. behind the item you will see a pit in the ground with a statue and a misbegotten at the bottom. get the drop on the enemy with a falling attack, and once he is defeated grab the somber smithing stone [6] from behind the statue. climb up out of the pit and walk forward a little ways and you will almost immediately be noticed by the leonine in the distance. once again, do not approach. let him come to you to avoid attracting other enemies. destroy him with barricade and guard counters again. here you will see a bunch of praying misbegottens, as well as some perfumers. this is a bit of a dangerous encounter because so many enemies will come after you at once, including a mix of melee and ranged attacks. making matters worse, the perfumers will give damage shields to the misbegottens. your best bet is to draw the enemies backwards down the stairs, until a few of them stop chasing, giving you the chance to face them in smaller groups. repeat this process a few times until the attire group has been culled, letting you grab the nascent butterfly x3 on the stairs and the exalted flesh that is hanging over the cliff. at the top of the stairs you will find an open tower with an elevator inside. pull the lever to take the elevator up. at the top are some weak soldiers guarding a bridge out of the city. we can't actually access this bridge until we defeat the area boss, but we can grab the flamedrake talisman +1 that is sitting here. from here we are going all the way back to the main street. as soon as you cross through the giant door that separated the ashy area from the main street look to your left and you will see a dark alleyway that weaves between the houses. jump over the fence and into the alley where you will encounter a number of foot soldiers resting, waiting to ambush you. kill them as you make your way forward, eventually taking out the final two guarding an item at the dead end. kill them to claim the imp head (corpse) . peek down the nearby path and you will see some knights standing in a clearing a short distance away. sneak over to them and you can get a backstab on the larger knight to begin this encounter, then try and kill off the weaker knight while he is recovering. these are two relatively powerful foes so don't let them overwhelm you in this small space. back away and try to separate them if needed, and remember guard counters do wonders against these guys. unfortunately starting this fight is likely to draw even more enemies from the nearby alleys, so keep your guard up and prepare for what could be a slightly drawn out encounter. once all the enemies are defeated go back to where that first knight was standing and check the nearby alleys to find an arteria leaf x2 in one of the dead ends. with those items in hand these alleyways are clear. head back out to the main path where you will probably notice an accessible plaza on the opposite side of the street. take the stairs down into the plaza where you will see exit doors on both your left and right. the left door takes you to a new area that we will come back to later so go to the right but do not rush in. inside this room you will see a crucible knight with a spear. you can sneak up on them to get the first strike, but then prepare yourself for a tough battle. because it does not have a shield this variant of the crucible knight can be easily beaten down with guard counters in its first phase, but when it powers up for phase two you will have to avoid some more dangerous attacks, including its multiple spear charge attacks. there is a flying dive (dodge roll forward just before the moment of impact), throwing spear (dodge roll left or right as the knight makes the throwing motion), and a long distance shoulder charge. the shoulder charge is deceptively quick, so be sure to always have your guard up or simply be ready to dodge left or right when you see the knight take a step forward. avoid these attacks and instead wait to punish its normal spear swings. defeat the knight and claim the hero rune [5] it was guarding, as well as the golden rune [9] in the corner. exit the room via the hallway near the golden rune to access a new elevator that takes you to a shortcut that goes back to the chapel near the east capital ramparts site of grace. with the shortcut open make your way back to the street, then all the way back to the caravan near where we battled the erdtree avatar way earlier. behind this caravan is a path leading back to the start of the area, but it is fraught with enemies. immediately you will encounter another knight resting at the top of the stairs. defeat him, then check the alleyway on the left to find a weaker soldier and fan daggers x8. continue up the path toward the open door, but instead go left into the alleyway where you will likely encounter a knight patrolling the area. kill or sneak past the night and go into the building nearby. pass through the room with the sleeping soldier and into the room with all the debris where you will find a miranda powder x10. break through the debris to get into the main hallway of the building. crouch and sneak into the larger room to the right. get a backstab on the perfumer resting to the left of the doorway, then prepare yourself to face off against two more who are standing by the bar on the opposite side of the room (you can draw them into the hallway if you need to split them up, or give them less room to move around). once the room is clear you can grab the golden rune [10] and warming stone x5. go back into the hallway where you will see a staircase to your right, but instead go past it and through the door to a patio. here you will encounter another perfumer and a smithing stone [6]. go back inside and up the stairs. head outside past the sleeping soldiers then sneak your way into the room ahead. backstab the resting perfumer, then kill whatever other enemies get up a a result of your disturbance. grab the preserving boluses next to the ladder, then climb the ladder to find yet another large room. there is a chest hidden behind some of the furniture in the back of the room. open it to get a perfume bottle . across the room you will see some windows you can climb out of to reach a balcony, but first go up the stairs to the top floor and loot the seedbed curse from the dead body in the chair. go back downstairs and out onto the balcony which you will see connects to another patio with two perfumers on it. sneak up and backstab the one, then focus the other before he can start casting shields onto the weaker soldier enemies. with the enemies dead go around the corner toward the item in the distance, but look out for the other perfumer waiting in ambush on the left. kill him then grab the upper-class robe at the dead end. head back to main street where we have just two areas left to explore. keep heading west down the street, keeping your eye out for an alleyway with three dogs guarding an item, an old fang x3. keeping heading down the street, looking for the staircase just past the overturned caravan on the left side. head up these stairs to find yourself on a small plaza with a perfumer and some soldiers. kill the perfumer first to prevent it from casting any spells, then turn your focus on the weak soldiers. grab the smithing stone [5] inside the gazebo. instead of going up the main stairs look on the left side of the building here to find a smaller staircase leading up to the street above. you will see two soldiers resting near an alleyway ahead. make a little noise by running and they should get up and chase after you. draw them toward the stairs to avoid pulling in any other nearby enemies. once they are out of the way check the alleyway they were guarding to find a golden rune [8]. exit the alleyway and go west where you will encounter a staircase going down with three soldiers on it. kill them and look ahead and you will see one of those large perfumer beasts on a large pile of sand, guarding a few items. your best bet here is just to run and try and get behind him before he can start spreading his flames. once behind you can easily kill him and claim the items: a golden rune [8], golden rune [11], and somber smithing stone [5]. turn around and start making your way down toward the other end of the street. there are two knights and two soldiers guarding the path. try and draw the knights out first as they patrol back and forth. take them out one by one, then kill the two soldiers together. go around to the backside of the building the soldiers were standing in front of to find another soldiers guarding lordsworn's bolt x10. head back to the street where you will see an item hanging over a nearby railing. grab it to get gravel stone x2, then look the body on the other side of the street to get a golden rune [13]. up ahead is a gazebo guarded by, you guessed it, more soldiers. defeat them to claim the tarnished golden sunflower x8 behind the gazebo. look over the railing next to the gazebo and you will see one of those giant lion enemies sleeping next to a fountain, along with a perfumer. this is a very delicate encounter. you need to rush in and kill the perfumer right away or he will be casting spells and making it impossible to focus on the lion. as usual you want to wait out the lion's heavy slam attacks before you try and punish. most of its light attacks (bites and swipes) are immediately followed with another attack which will interrupt you. keep your shield up and guard counter if you see an opening, but for the most part its best to just anticipate the heavy combo ending attacks then get in one or two attacks. if you need a second to breathe you can use the fountain to separate yourself from the lion but not for long because he will jump around or over it. defeating the lion will get you a somber smithing stone [6], beast blood , and old fang x2. you can also loot the items behind him, a golden rune [10] and hero rune [2]. head back to the gazebo and look for the nearby cracked railing. look down and you will see another gazebo with an item on it. take a running jump from the ledge to reach the gazebo below and claim the stonesword key . take a look at the large spear hanging over your head, and notice that it is embedded into the building behind the gazebo. from the top of the gazebo you can actually jump to that spot and use it to climb up onto the spear. it is a bit of a slippery jump so it may take a few tries but once you are on top you can climb up onto the spear and grab the bolt of gransax weapon. there are some other enemies below, as well as a shortcut to a new area, but we aren't ready to move on yet so you can ignore them for now. get back to the main street so we can clean up the last bit of loot on the west end. behind one last overturned caravan is a tall staircase guarded by two soldiers and a knight. as usual you will want to draw out the soldiers first, then move onto the knight once they are out of the way. clear the stairs then grab all the items: a lightningproof dried liver , golden rune [8], and golden rune [12]. last but not least, go left at the bottom of the tall stairs and look behind the stairs in the back alley to find a golden rune [8]. it is time to take on the area below the avenue balcony, but our first order of business is going to be opening up one more shortcut. head back to the plaza where you encountered that crucible knight earlier, but instead go through the door on the opposite side and go down the elevator. you will find yourself in a sort of slummy looking town area. the streets are littered with those zombie enemies, so first we are going to jump onto the roof to your right and cross the town this way. you will find the black bow on top of one of the roofs on the other side of the town. drop down to street level and start doing some cleaning of the neighborhood. there are about a dozen enemies total hanging around the various streets and alleys of this small area so clear them all out and you can begin grabbing the items. there is a golden rune [9], gravel stone , smithing ston e [4], and a stonesword key . once you have all these items in hand go through the door on the opposite end of town into the store room, which is full of soldiers who will start chucking electric bombs at you. run across to the far side of the room and climb up onto the ledge above so you can kill them all off before they become an issue. at the top of this room you will find clarifying boluses, and then another stonesword key in a chest in the cage underneath. climb up the ladder in the corner of the room to reach a door that leads back to the avenue balcony site of grace. you will want to rest because it is time to take on another mini-boss: a tree spirit. go back into the slum and cross the bridge to the wrecked half of the town. immediately turn left and head for the doorway ahead of you. this leads to a large room with a resting knight and a cracked pot . there is also a backdoor that's leads to another part of the town, but ignore that for now. it was important to clear that room because it is going to be your panic room in case things go badly while fighting the next enemy. head back outside and into the clearing to summon the tree spirit. as usual you will want to stay close to the spirit most of the time. stand next to its belly, just under its arm. this will help you avoid most of its forward slam and breath attacks, and make it easy to stay close when dodge rolling through its tail spins and body rolls. it telegraphs most of its movements pretty heavily, so keep an eye out any time it begins to contort its body it is probably about to spin or dash attack in some way. keep your shield up at all time. at about half health the spirit will glow gold and ignite itself with flames. you need to back away to avoid the powerful explosion, but after that it is back to business as usual. the other attack you always need to keep an eye out for is the bite, where the spirit will pull back, open its mouth wide, then dash at you and swallow you. this can be easily avoided by just rolling to the side, but if you don't notice it coming and attempt to block with your shield you will get gobbled up. and remember, you can back up into the large room any time things get hectic. just don't stand too close to the door because the spirit's attacks can hit you through the wall. defeat the spirit to claim a golden seed , then you can grab the other loot in the area including a smithing stone [6] and golden arrow x15. with this area clear you can hop into the sewer between the two sides of the town and grab the guilty hood from the end of the path. turn around and start walking along the sewer until you enter a small room with some rats, a golden rune [8], and a hefty beast bone . on the other side you will find a staircase leading up to a new part of town, but first we are going to explore these sewers further. head through the next doorway and you will find yourself in a long corridor with some rats and some of those small hand enemies. clear the room of enemies and grab the string x4 off the nearby body, then take the left path, where some more of the hands will fall on you as you pass by. grab the poisonbone dart x8 at the end of this path, then go back and take the turn leading to yet another long corridor. this one however has one of the giant hand enemies waiting at the end. he will drop down as you approach, and some of his little minions will try and sneak up behind you. kill them all to claim the lost ashes of war the giant hand was watching over. retrace your steps back to the doorway you came in through, but this time we are going to take the opposite path down the corridor. immediately take a right to get a few nascent butterfly from a dead end (you can see a rune arc on the other side of the grate). return to the main corridor and keep going down and you will find yourself behind one of those large perfumer beasts. kill it and drop to the sewer below where you will find three items: fan daggers x5, holyproof dried liver , and an erdsteel dagger . use the ladder on the opposite side of this room to get out. you will find yourself under the wing of the giant dragon corpse that hangs over the city. check the nearby stairs to find a dragonwound grease . turn around and you will see a couple of knights standing in the street ahead of you, which leads directly back to the avenue balcony. check the railing on the left side here to find a golden rune [9], then kill all the knights to clear the way back to the site of grace if you need to rest. return to the ladder that you used to get out of the sewers earlier. nearby you will see a staircase. follow the stairs down and you will be in yet another wrecked town. follow along the right side wall and you will come across a somber smithing stone [6] behind some broken houses. to the left of this item you will see a large pile of sand and rubble. climb to the top and over it and you will find yourself on top of a small house overlooking the sewer. from here you can see an item hanging off the ledge on the other side. drop down on the left, then climb over the rubble in front of you to get to the other side and grab the item, a smithing stone [5]. do not drop down into the sewer, instead head toward the clearing on the right. here there is a group of those crawling enemies, as well as an ash scarab. kill the crawlers, then walk over to the well in the north corner of this area. nearby you will find an albinauric bloodclot . climb down into the sewer and grab the rune arc at the bottom. the gate here takes you to subterranean shunning-grounds , but we won't be exploring that area at this time, take the ladder back up to the capital. around the corner from the well is a doorway that leads into a long hall. at the end is a body with a pickled turtle neck x3 on it. drop out of the opening at the end of the hall and you will find yourself back where we fought the tree spirit earlier. go right and into the store room with the knight. exit through the door on the other side to find yourself overlooking the sewer again. instead, take the ladder to the left up to reach a new area. you will see a church on the right, and an omenkiller on the left. as usual this omenkiller can be easily cheese with guard counters. your reward for killing him is the omensmirk mask , as well as the smithing stone [6] that is sitting behind him. go into the nearby church to find the lower capital church site of grace, as well as the lionel's armor set and deathbed dress . with that, we are ready to progress to the next part of the capital. return to the avenue balcony site of grace and head back down into the area with all the knights. here you will see a giant dragon's wing you can climb onto. walk up the edge of the wing and then at the top climb up onto the dragon's arm. from here you can jump to a broken section of castle wall. here you will find a rune arc and a ladder. ascend the ladder then go up the stairs ahead. there will be a knight looking over a ledge on your left. kill him to grab the gravel stone x5 next to him. walk up the stairs nearby where there is a soldier waiting to ambush, and a golden rune [11]. just ahead is the west capital rampart site of grace. first order of business from this site of grace is going to be killing the nearby gargoyle mini-boss. go down the nearby stairs and walk along the top of the rampart until you come up to the gargoyle standing guard in front of you. he will not aggro until you attack, so use this opportunity to open with your strongest ability. defeating the gargoyles basically comes down to patience and consistency. almost all of their attacks are forward slashes and stabs which can be easily dodged by rolling in or simply blocked with a 100% physical block shield. these attacks usually only leave the gargoyle open for about one counter attack, so take your shot wisely then go back on the defensive. the most punishable attacks are definitely his various aerial slams and ground stabs, so keep an eye out for these most of all. when he leaps backwards with his sword he is going to do a long range slash across the ground which you can dodge with a simple sideways roll. the attack you want to avoid most of all is the tornado slam, which he can only do with the axe. he will do a short hop and raise the axe high into the air as a whirlwind gathers around him, followed by multiple circular swings, then a giant slam. this combination can easily break your shield leaving you open to the big hit, so just try and back off as soon as you see the first hit coming. with enough patience and proper dodges you can slowly whittle this annoying foe down and claim the gargoyle's halberd he drops upon death, as well as the golden seed sitting by the golden tree nearby. with the gargoyle down we can do some proper exploring. head back to the site of grace to rest, then go down the staircase that is right outside the site of grace doorway. below is a platform with a few envoys, a lever that opens the large door below (connecting to the street above avenue balcony), and a golden rune [9]. turn around and head back up the stairs, but make sure you grab the cane sword from the hallway next to the bottom of the stairs. head back to where you battled the gargoyle where you will find another staircase leading down into the rampart. look out for the perfumer hiding next to the staircase (beware his triple explosive shot), then grab the smithing stone [6] hanging over the nearby ledge. go back up to the top of the rampart and continue following it down, past the spot where you battled the gargoyle and up onto the giant tree root. take a right and follow the tree root down into the sandy area below. you will encounter some dogs waiting at the bottom, but more importantly some wooden shacks to the left, one of which has an item hanging off of it. use the smaller shack to climb onto the taller one and grab the golden rune [9] off the top. this shack is leaning up against a balcony that allows you to get inside the giant building it is leaning up against. head through the door and you will find yourself in a familiar location: the roundtable. in this first hallway you will find the sanctified whetblade and hammer weapon. look down the staircase to the left where you will find a smithing stone [6], then enter the room on the left side of the hall to find two more items: a hero's rune [1] and the by my sword gesture. head into the main roundtable room where you will find a rune arc on the table. on the balcony you will find a smithing stone [5]. head to sir gideon's room to find a furlcalling finger remedy , then go to the back room where dungeater would be hanging out where you will find another seedbed curse . finally open the door to the main room where the two-fingers would normally be to find the coded sword . go back to the hallway where the blacksmith would be normally and drop down the broken staircase where you found the smithing stone earlier. take an immediately left and go down the hall into the dining room at the end where you will find black-key bolt x20 and two finger's prayerbook . make your way back down the hallway and into the main hall of the manor where you will find alberich's armor set near the front. go through the doorway closest to the armor set where you can find a smithing stone [5] hidden in the corner behind some weapon racks. go through the connecting dining hall and you will find a small room with the fortified manor first floor site of grace and the " flightless bird" painting . return to the main hall and go to the final doorway you haven't explored. push open the door then go through the door at the end of the hallway to arrive in a courtyard patrolled by two abductors. take them on one by one, carefully blocking their charging attacks and waiting for them to open their hatch and expose their weak spot. once both are dead you are free to grab the items scattered around the courtyard: somber smithing stone [6] in the outer hall, stormhawk axe and nascent butterfly x3 in the garden. there is an elevator nearby that will take you up to the divine bridge site of grace, and a teleporter that will take you to the isolated divine tower which we cannot yet access. instead, return to the first floor of the fortified manor and get ready to explore the area outside of it. step out through the front door and go immediately left where you will encounter two knights: one with a spear and another with a bow. to avoid being destroyed by arrows, try and draw the spear knight into one of the wooden shacks to the right of the path. here you can easily defeat him in a one on one duel, then step out and run up on the bow knight with ease. once both are defeated you can grab the old fang x5 from the nearby shack, then the gravel stone x3 behind the dragon. next, climb up onto the dragon's leg and jump off of its talon and onto the wooden shack below it. from here you can make a running jump into the taller adjacent wooden shack and grab the two items inside: smithing stone [6] and stonesword key . teleport back to the west capital rampart site of grace and make your way down the rampart once again, this time walking under the giant tree root and up the stairs on the other side. you will immediately encounter a duelist enemy patrolling up and down the path. these guys are incredibly susceptible to being guard countered, so put your shield up and beat him down. continue up the path until you reach the building at the top where you will face another duelist and find the ritual shield talisman . go right from the front door and into the archway where you will find a furlcalling finger remedy . next, make your way around to the other side of the building where you will find a smithing stone [5] hanging over the cliff, and the star fist weapon inside the archway on the other side. make your way back down to the staircase at the base of the hill. look over the railing and you will see some plant enemies on a cliffside below. drop down then go down the staircase on the left side of the cliff to find a smithing stone [6] on the broken bridge. get back on the cliffside and follow it to the end where you will find another large tree root you can climb. head up the tree root, taking note of the tree warrior enemies along the way. they are relatively weak and their attacks are easily blocked with a good shield, but there are a lot of them so be careful not to get overwhelmed especially considering the limited space. navigate the path carefully, working your way up to the very highest root which will lead you to a large chapel. before you enter the chapel, run down the thin root that breaks off from the larger one near the top which will lead you to the roof below. go around the corner to find an enemy and a holy grease x3. if you feel ready to take on the mid-boss, head back to the chapel and go inside to find... godfrey is a fairly classic humanoid boss. his moveset is made up of a variety of slow powerful axe swings, most of which are easily blocked with a 100% physical block shield, or simply rolled through before impact. he has almost no tricks save for a few deceptive combos, so of course we are going to adopt a similarly classic strategy to whup him. first thing, avoid his leaping axe throw attack that he opens the battle with my rolling in as he executes the throw. get control of the center of the room to get yourself some space. our game plan here is to stand just out of his normal range in an attempt to bait out one of his long range overhead slams or jump attacks. these are some of his most obvious swings and the most punishable, in particular the attack where he leaps into the air then jabs the ground with the point of his axe. if you see this attack be ready to punish with 2-3 attacks. when it comes to his weaker attacks you want to be more wary. his quick axe swipes and horizontal slashes are usually followed up by another quick attack or a slightly delayed heavier slam. i would not recommend trying to punish these unless you are using a very quick weapon. it is better to just wait for a familiar attack than to try and punish during a combo just because you are antsy. however the stomp, one of his more frequent attacks, does seem to be punishable if you can roll to his side and strike him from behind. because his combos are so delayed, you can even fit in a guard counter between most of his attacks. if you are feeling confident in your stamina and defense stand right in front of him and simply tank the swings (especially easy if you have the barricade shield ability) then counter repeatedly until you get the stagger. just be aware of your stamina at all times or he may open you up and get a kill off one of his powerful combos. godfrey doesn't seem to have a second phase change, so simply follow the game plan and he will eventually fall to your combination of safe punishes and guard counters. he is very slow moving, so if you need a moment of rest you can simply roll back or run away to create some distance. defeat him to get another talisman pouch and get access to the erdtree sanctuary site of grace. with godfrey out of the way our path to the area boss is basically wide open, but there are a few more items we need to grab first. start by going left from the site of grace towards the door, but take a right just before the door to find a somber smithing stone [5] in a room off to the side. go back to the door and head outside and down the staircase, and into the building at the end which contains an elevator. take the elevator down then head outside and down the stairs where you will encounter two perfumers. once they are dead you can grab the item they were guarding, a holy grease x5. continue down the path and you will encounter one of those invisible ash scarabs prancing around, but before we can deal with that we need to defeat the crucible knight that is patrolling the staircase (refer to the strategy detailed above for defeating crucible knights). once the knight is defeated you can wait at the top of the stairs where the scarab runs in circles for a moment and strike it to get the barrier of gold spell. with these items in hand you can return to the erdtree sanctuary site of grace for some more looting. this time go right from the site of grace and out onto the balcony. on the right side of the balcony is a path leading to a holy grease x6, and on the other side is a large tree root you can climb to reach the upper floor of the erdtree sanctuary. from this platform you can step out onto a long bridge that leads to another building, but first we wanna look to the left where you can see an accessible rooftop. jump onto the roof then get back into the building through the open window on the side of the building. once inside you can go right to find a chest with the erdtree bow , then enter the nearby room to find a celestial dew and a ladder that creates a shortcut to the lower level. explore the rest of the upper level and you will find another tree root you can run along to reach a hanging chair suspended in the middle of the room. loot the item on the chair to get the golden order principia . from here go right back to the upper level bridge we split off from earlier. cross the bridge to reach the building at the other end where you will encounter one of the black knife assassins. these guys are fast and annoying, but their quick weak attacks make them very susceptible to guard counters when you can actually catch them. see if you can push him up against a wall or corner to remove his escape options. the one unblockable attack is the grab, which the assassin telegraphs by raising his hand into the air then dashing forward. if you see this motion dodge away as quick as you can or you will take big damage from his back stabbing attack. once you have defeated the assassin you can enter the room he was guarding, loot the blessing of the erdtree spell, and activate the queen's bedchamber site of grace just outside the boss room. once you feel prepared, ascend the staircase leading up to the fog door and prepare to battle... surprise! morgott, the omen king was hiding in front of our eyes this entire time. he's back and better than ever with a new sword and a whole bunch of new abilities (along with some old tricks). this is not as simple of a fight as godfrey was, but with a good shield and a careful approach (and maybe some help from the melina summon) we can take him down and claim another great rune. much of the difficulty of this fight comes from morgott's unpredictability. he can move around quickly, summon a few different weapons, and he has a few fake combo enders and surprisingly long combos, making it tough to pinpoint when the right moment to punish is. during the first phase the general rule of thumb is to punish any time he uses a hammer attack, as those are the slowest and have the longest cooldown. the high leap into the air in particular leaves morgott open for 2-3 attacks afterward. as always, guard counters can also be effective assuming you have the stamina management to use them without getting guard broken. occasionally morgott will strike out with a weak attack and then raise his sword over his head in a sort of circular motion. this is a great opening to counter the weak hit, then roll dodge the heavy sword swing and punish after for a good chunk of damage. for any other attack be on your guard, since he loves to follow up most of his normal attacks with a quick dagger swipe or a step back dagger throw, which may interrupt your attempt to attack or kill you while you try to find a moment to heal. another attack to avoid is the sword rain. if you see the swords appear in the air you may be able to sneak in one attack before they start falling, but otherwise get away to avoid the initial burst of damage, then avoid the area of effect afterwards. at about half health morgott will fall to his knees and vomit, signaling the start of phase two. if you have a bleed or freeze weapon maybe try and sneak in 1-2 hits here to build the effect, but otherwise get away before he rises with his area of effect explosion attack. in phase two things become a bit more complicated. not only does he have new attacks, but his old ones have some changes as well. for example, the hammer slams now trigger an explosion shortly after impact, meaning you only have a small opening to attack afterwards without risking taking area of effect damage. the new punishable attack is his bloody sword. he will run his hand along the blade, turning it red, before either slashing or dashing in. dodge roll into him to avoid the slash and the small blood explosions that trigger afterward, then hit him 1-2 times in the back while he is regaining his posture. if he does a stutter step before slashing that usually means he will do two slashes, and if he holds the blade in a thrusting motion instead of over his head he is going to try and impale you. all of these variations can be dodged and punished in similar ways, just be aware that each has a slightly different timing and hitbox. just like phase one, do not even try to punish the other combos unless you are very confident you know what is coming. anytime he summons his light dagger or sword it usually means a rapid attack combo is coming your way. it is much safer to just block or avoid these attacks completely and wait out a more obvious and slow move. if you are really struggling with morgott the good news is you have some extra tools to fall back on. melina can be summoned in front of the boss door, providing you backup with a mix of physical attacks and ranged spells. you can also use an ash summon of your choice, though i would recommend waiting until phase two begins since that is when things really turn up. defeating morgott will get you remembrance of the omen king and morgott's great rune . you can also speak to morgott's husk in the boss arena afterward to get a little extra lore. /n mountaintops of the giants is one of the last two regions in elden ring. this page includes an overview of the area, including all main dungeons, bosses, loot, and secrets to find in this region. mountaintops of the giants is the region you'll reach after exploring leyndell, royal capital on the altus plateau, and beating morgott, omen king . this snowy region is home to some of the

this time. make your way southeast unto the bridge leading to the divine tower of east altus. your screen will go black and trigger the fell twins field boss as you move across the bridge. the fight shouldn't be challenging, especially if you managed to defeat the first omen killer before the second one comes running in. spirit ashes are available for summons for this fight as well. they drop the omen killer spirit ash upon defeat. continue your way to the divine tower of east altus to restore morgott's great rune. spoiler: tap to reveal mohgwyn's dynasty mausoleum . from the forbidden lands site of grace, ride your way east towards the grand lift of rold. there are two roaming bosses to encounter in the forbidden lands; the night's cavalry that spawns at nighttime and the black blade kindred guarding the entrance to the lift. the former is close to the site of grace, and he drops the ash of war - phantom slash upon defeat. the black blade kindred drops both of his weapons upon defeat. there is also a phantom tree with a golden seed underneath it near this boss fight. the zamor ruins should be the first point of interest you come across after taking the grand lift of rold. turning the corner from the main path, you can see shabriri next to the zamor ruins site of grace. the map fragment for the mountaintops of the giants (west) is also here. the majority of the ruins are south of the site of grace, and several knights of zamor highly guard it. these knights are one of the most formidable regular enemies you can encounter, so we recommend either taking them out one at a time or avoiding them altogether. you can grab two significant loots here; the first is the zamor ice storm sorcery on a corpse in the southernmost section of the ruins. the second is the smithing-stone miner's bell bearing 3 in the underground chamber of zamor ruins—the entrance is southwest of the corpse where you find the sorcery earlier. to get to the shack of the lofty, head north from the ancient snow valley ruins site of grace and go left once you've made it to the middle of the valley. you should soon see vampire bats fighting misbegotten underneath the bridge. as you get closer to the shack, juno hoslow will invade your world. defeat him to obtain his armor set and his whip. inside, you can find the traveling maiden set on a corpse. the stargazer's ruins are located on a plateau above the western side of the valley—you can get here by crossing the bridge above the shack of the lofty. that very same bridge will contain the reward for the sorcerer painting, which you can find inside castle sol . as you go inside the ruins, you'll find a talking and non-hostile spirit jellyfish looking for her sister. though you can't interact with her, you can summon the spirit jellyfish ashes to reunite the sisters. after a brief conversation, the two spirit jellyfish will disappear, unlocking the previously sealed underground chamber. make your way down, open the chest inside the room, and grab the primal glinstone blade. this unmarked location spans the landmass overlooking the snow valley to the south and castle sol to the north. you can find a site of grace nearby the bridge that connects the overlook to the minor erdtree plateau. the eastern half of this overlook has no notable loot. however, the western half contains two roaming bosses that drop splendid weapons. the tibia mariner is just northwest of the area's site of grace, on a ridge directly south of castle. this boss drops a deathroot and the helphen's steeple greatsword upon defeat. the second boss, death rite bird, is located on the westernmost section of the overlook down the snow-capped cliffs before castle sol. it is highly recommended not to fight this boss on horseback, as its attacks area of effect will hit you even at full speed. the death rite bird is also highly susceptible to holy damage, so consider that before fighting it. the boss will drop its weapon upon defeat—the death ritual spear . the last minor erdtree in the game, this one is located across the bridge south of the snow valley ruins overlook. this dead minor erdtree contains an erdtree avatar field boss—it drops the cerulean crystal tear and the crimson bubbletear upon defeat. looking down the valley towards the direction of the heretical rise, you can see a phantom tree with a golden seed down below. you can drop the series of giant tombstones extending out the side of the cliffs to get down there. those accessing the heretical rise are most likely coming from the south. the main entrance to the tower is blocked by a seal, requiring you to find another entry. travel to the snow valley ruins overlook and ride east until you get to the broken bridge across the tower. though seemingly destroyed, the bridge is invisible, allowing you to traverse it and get to the balcony of the heretical rise. it is highly recommended to use rainbow stones as you get closer to the tower, as it can help you trace the correct path. you can also use the ash of war - hoarfrost stomp to reveal the course easier. /n mountaintops of the giants is one of the last two regions in elden ring.

lake site of grace nearby the birdeye telescope. head directly east of the telescope, and you should soon see the footsteps of an invisible teardrop scarab. when killed, it will drop the ash of war - seppuku . as you get closer to the lake's center, you'll notice that your screen is covered by a constant blizzard that prevents you from seeing the surrounding area. get ready for a field boss encounter, as borealis the freezing dog dragon will soon fly in to initiate the fight. as a great enemy, borealis is one of the most challenging dragon bosses in elden ring. his breath attacks not only inflicts frostbite, but it camouflages well with the frozen lake due to the constant blizzard. it is highly recommended to fight him during the daytime for better visibility and bring thawfrost boluses to clear the frost buildup. defeating him will net you one dragon heart and allow you to purchase the borealis's mist dragon incantation at the cathedral of dragon communion in caelid . the last church of marika in the game, this one also contains a sacred tear to upgrade your flask. as you move closer to the church, you'll soon find a corpse outside its entrance—pick up the somberstone miner's bell bearing 3 from it. there is a site of grace to activate inside the church as well. the guardian's garrison is a fire priests-occupied fort with a relatively large camp on its outer walls. before further exploring the garrison, it is recommended to hit the whiteridge road site of grace just before the wooden barricades. there is also a stonesword key nearby the eastern wall. a fire monk guards the staircase that leads inside the garrison; you can either run past him or fight him from above the stairs to avoid attracting more enemies. head inside and immediately exit onto the balcony to pick up the golden rune 10 behind some wooden crates. be wary of the rotten stray to your right. go back inside and defeat the rest of the rotten strays. a flame guardian is waiting to attack you in the center of the garrison—he's relatively weak and is highly susceptible to sorceries and incantations. clear the enemies and head back down; there is a ladder hidden behind some crates below where you'd find the rats. follow the wooden walkway until you find another flame guardian on the upper level; there should be a third one at the very end of this floor. once you have killed both of them, look for a corpse holding a smithing stone 7 on the ground. slightly make your way back and look for wooden crates blocking a broken section of the garrison wall, break them and jump down to the wooden platform. make your way past the frozen corpses and around the center tower. heal if you need to, as there is a miniboss just around the corner. chief guardian arghanthy can be a tough challenge, as he uses a variety of high-level flame incantations. be especially careful of his flame pillars; he'll plunge his hands to the ground whenever he's about to cast this spell. upon defeat, he will drop his one-eyed shield . after defeating him, make your way inside the corner tower and climb the ladder. there are several frozen corpses surrounding a chest—open it and loot the giant's prayerbook inside. another straightforward church and aptly named for the last safe location in the region, this one contains a sacred tear as well. you'll soon be invaded by bloody finger okina when you get closer to the entrance—don't underestimate him as he is one of the strongest npc invaders in the game. he drops his katana, the rivers of blood , and his mask upon defeat. you can also find an ancient dragon smithing stone inside the skull of a dead giant southeast of the church. use the nearby spiritspring to get atop the massive rock, where you'll find the ash of war - troll's roar at its peak. the foot of the forge is an unmarked location that spans the area northeast of the church of repose. here you'll find several giant corpses frozen in place. from the foot of the forge site of grace, ride north until you find the phantom tree and the golden seed. keep moving north, and down the hill, there should be a few lesser spider hands here that drop somber smithing stone 7 when killed. turn left unto the narrow cliff—be extremely careful walking this path as the enemies can push you off the cliff with their attacks. you'll soon find the crimsonwhorl bubbletear guarded by several lesser spider hands. you can then jump down and heal at the giant's gravepost site of grace below. there is not much to say about the flame peak outside of it being a main bossfight arena for the fire giant. you can access it by going east from the church of repose and crossing the chain bridge. defeat the fire giant will net you access to the forge of the giants, where melina will assist you in burning the erdtree. as you explore this region, you may come across several scarabs scampering away. some of them will refill your flask of tears, but others can reward you with special items: reward: ash of war - seppuku this scarab is located just northeast of the freezing lake site of grace. you can find it leaving its footprints while rolling around the frozen lake. it might be hard to spot this one during the daytime due to the constant blizzard, so it is recommended to try finding it at night when the footprints are easier to spot. reward: ash of war - prelate's charge this scarab is located just outside of the guardian's garrison, inside the fire monk campsite. there are a few other scarabs nearby, but the one that drops the ash of war is actually hanging on the trunk of one of the trees. you might need a bow or sorcery/incantation to hit it. /n forge of the giants is an important story location found in the final region in elden ring, mountaintops of the giants , located in the far north. the mountaintops is a relatively straightforward snowy area with a few dungeons and one major story boss needed to progress the story. this page will contain walkthrough focused guide information on how to reach mountaintops of the giants, how to navigate between the various sites of grace, and defeat the area boss at the end. how to get to mountaintops of the giants mountaintops of the giants walkthrough fire giant boss fight forge of the giants after defeating the boss of leyndell, royal capital the the magic barrier blocking the bridge on the eastern edge of the city will dissipate, allowing you to cross over to the elevator on the other side. take the elevator down and you will find yourself in the forbidden lands. activate and rest at the site of grace just outside the elevator, then hop on torrent and start riding down the foggy path ahead of you. as you can see from the map above, the path here is incredibly thin and straight forward. the only obstacle in your way are a number of vulgar militia members waiting to ambush you as well as a bunch of poison traps. just ride forward, ignore the enemies, and be careful not to fall off the ledge. just before you reach the end of the path you should ride right past a golden seed tree, so be sure you keep an eye out and grab it along the way. at the end of the path is the grand lift of rold, guarded by yet another gargoyle: the black blade kindred . this fight is highly similar to the gargoyle we battled on the ramparts of the capital. the gargoyle's moveset is made of a bunch of devastating long range attacks, but thankfully they are fairly slow and obvious as well. the general game plan should be to keep your shield up, dodge the ones you can, and only punish the big, obvious combo finishing attacks. the gargoyle's combos can be a little deceptive and his range is much longer than you will expect, so don't assume you can just roll away and drink a flask between his attacks. the gargoyle's lanky body can make him hard to hit sometimes, so i would recommend using some jumping heavy attacks instead of grounded attacks whenever possible. these also deal a lot of topple damage, which could result in a massive punish. be careful and patient and you will eventually wear him down. your reward for winning is the gargoyle's black blades and the gargoyle's black axe , as well as access to the grand lift of rold. walk up to the lift and use the medallion to activate the elevator up to the mountaintops of the giants. step off the elevator and head down the mountain trail in front of you where you will immediately encounter the area map. grab it, then go forward where you can find the zamor ruins site of grace. with the map revealed you can see that this is a relatively small and straightforward area. we need to get to the forge in the bottom right corner of the map. we are going to follow the path laid out in the image above. start going up the hill to the left of the zamor ruins near the site of grace. go around the edge of the clifftop and you will come across a long stone bridge, guarded by some perfumers. once you are across the bridge go up the mountain ahead of you and between the cliffsides where you will find the frozen lake. go northeast, keeping an eye out for the golden seed tree on the right as you run up the river. grab the site of grace on the edge of the frozen lake, then cross the lake where you will find the first church of marika with another site of grace inside. run along the cliff's edge until you reach a chain bridge, near the guardian's garrison castle. grab the giant's gravepost site of grace on the other side of the chain bridge. from here you just need to go up the hill and past some dangerous enemies (including a giant hand) to reach the foot of the forge site of grace. go around the corner and you should see another chain bridge leading to the one last mountaintop, where you will encounter... this massive boss arena comes along with a fittingly massive foe, the fearsome fire giant . this battle is a bit simple and gimmicky, but the giant's powerful attacks can make it a bit challenging as well. our boss guide should help you get through it quicker. this battle features two phases, both of quick require you to focus on a weak spot on the giant's body. when the battle begins you will want to stay on foot, holding up your shield until the giant does his snow shoveling attack. once the snow has dispersed jump onto torrent and ride up to his feet. the giant's first weak spot is his left ankle, which you will notice is wrapped up in some primitive bandages. strike the bandage a few times to cause it to break, stunning the giant momentarily and exposing the wound underneath. continue striking the ankle, always staying slightly behind the foot to avoid the giant's frontward facing slam attacks. you will also need to look out for his fire spells and foot stomps. if he casts the slow moving fire orb you will want to run up to it to trigger it to explode, then get out of the radius before the explosion happens. if the ground begins to catch on fire you need to make sure you are not standing on top of any of the burning spots, as they will soon explode causing damage. avoid all of these attacks and keep hitting the ankle until the giant reaches about half health, at which point phase two will begin. the giant will tear off his foot and the eye on his chest will open, revealing his second weak spot. in this phase of the fight you will want to stay on torrent the entire time, constantly weaving in and out of his melee range and striking him one or two times per pass. the attack we are looking for is his body slam, which will momentarily cause him to lay on his side allowing you to strike his eye directly. while you wait for that attack there are a number of other attacks you need to avoid: if he leans back he is preparing to spit fiery rocks from the mouth on his chest. these will pepper the ground around him, but are relatively easy to see coming and avoid on torrent. try and get behind him and strike his legs. if you get too far away he will begin firing homing fireballs that deal massive damage. for this reason you will want to stay behind him and close to him as much as possible. never get underneath the giant or else he may do his body roll and crush you underneath. this also applies to being to the side of him. stay behind his legs as much as you can. if he leans forward in a sort of plank position he is going to spew fire onto the ground. just get away as fast as possible to avoid getting caught in the area of effect. in general, stay behind and close to the giant as often as possible. don't get greedy with your hits and keep an eye out for the body slam to get maximum damage on his eye. just be careful not to stay close to the eye for too long or you will give him the opportunity to execute his powerful fire breath attack. keep up the hit and runs for long enough and you will bring the fire giant down and claim his reward: the remembrance of the fire giant . with the fire giant defeated you can proceed to the top of flame peak and ride onto the large chain that connects the peak to the forge of the giants in the distance. once you are on the forge you need to ride around to the other side where you can activate the forge of the giants site of grace. here you can opt to speak to melina and choose to "commit the cardinal sin" and she puts it. saying yes to her seems to be the point of no return for some of the sidequests and content in the game, so be sure you have done everything you want to do before progressing past this point. /n consecrated snowfield is the final region in elden ring. this page includes an overview of the area, including all main dungeons, bosses, loot, and secrets to find in this region. consecrated snowfield is a remote region located on the lower western plains of mountaintops of the giants . there is only one way you can gain access to this region, and that's by finding both halves of the haligtree secret medallion and hoisting it in the grand lift of rold. almost half of the consecrated snowfield is constantly under a blizzard, reducing your vision significantly. only until you reach the frozen river can you see the rest of the region without hinder. though it is the last region in the game, the consecrated snowfield holds secret entrances to two important late-game areas— mohgwyn's palace and miquella's haligtree . to reveal the details and topography of the whole mountaintops of the giants region, you'll need to find three map fragments at the steles located in mountaintops of the giants (east & west) and the consecrated snowfield. finding these three map fragments will fully complete the map of the lands between, revealing the entire overworld of elden ring. the consecrated snowfield map fragment is located at a stele found after making your way past the blizzard and across the frozen river. the stele is nearby the pack of wolves chasing an invisible teardrop scarab. this region is home to several world bosses that can be found outside of dungeons, some of which roam in certain areas and others that are hiding until you draw close enough to trigger their arrival. npc humans also have several scripted invasions that will force you into a conflict. click on a boss below to learn more about how to defeat them. boss name reward night's cavalry x2 ancient dragon smithing stone, night's cavalry set great worm

snowfield site of grace to broken pillars inside the snowstorm. when you first come across the grace site, head west until you see the stone coffins. you'll soon hear the sounds of chains dragging across the ground, indicating that the rotten duelist is somewhere nearby. be wary of the edge of the cliffs when fighting him, as falling will cause instant death. the rotten duelist drops his helm and his rotten battlehammer upon defeat. now go back to the site of grace and follow the main path north; though covered by snow, you can still find your course by following the wandering nobles holding torches. the nomadic warrior's cookbook 23 should be nearby on a corpse lying by the road. the first moving caravan of the region starts on the same path where you find the nomadic warrior's cookbook 23 , just a short distance north of it. move northwest from the corpse until you see broken pillars inside the blizzard. be careful of the albinauric wolfback archers roaming the area—they can be a challenge, mainly due to the constant snowstorm. there is a golden seed you can loot by the central pillar in the middle. keep moving on the main road; the moving caravan can be hard to see, but the trolls dragging it should give their position away. this caravan is not very guarded, so jump on the back and loot the st. trina's torch from the chest. head northwest until you see a few wandering nobles, with one trying to help the other half-buried in the snow. in reality, the half-buried pilgrim is a disguised runebear. the runebear will drop a larval tear when killed. be sure to hit the inner consecrated snowfield site of grace just a short distance northwest of here. head west from the inner consecrated snowfield site of grace until you get to a vast open field. wait a brief moment, and the moving caravan should be arriving in your direction shortly. the last moving caravan in the game is bound to be a challenge, as formidable enemies and two roaming bosses guard this one. however, the two night's cavalry will only spawn alongside the moving caravan at night, so be sure to tackle this point of interest during nightfall. you can fight the bosses one at a time as long as you grab its attention without alerting the other—you can do this without range spells or arrows if you get close enough to one night cavalry and lure it away from the caravan. one of the night's cavalry drops their entire armor set, while the other drops an ancient dragon smithing stone. kill the rest of the caravan and loot the flowing curved sword ] from the chest. you can get to the albinauric rise by riding east from the inner consecrated snowfield site of grace. on your way there, you should run into three schools of graven mages encircling a corpse holding the glintstone craftman's cookbook 8 . from there, the tower shouldn't be too far. the albinauric rise's puzzle is unique in that there are two ways to solve it. regardless of which solutions you decide to go with, head inside the tower once you've broken the seal. get to the top floor to loot the graven-mass talisman sitting on a pile of crystals. from the albinauric rise, drop onto the frozen river and head east until you encounter the frozen waterfall. the entrance to the cave of the forlorn is not very far from here as well. get ready for a boss fight approaching the waterfall, as great wyrm theodorix will soon spawn. a great enemy, great wyrm theodorix is capable of using devastating magma breaths alongside its giant sword. it will drop three dragon hearts upon defeat. you will also be able to obtain theodorix's magma incantation from the cathedral of dragon communion in caelid . after defeating it, don't leave the area just yet. go to the right side of the waterfall and jump on the ledges to get to the other side. there is a corpse above that holds an ancient dragon smithing stone. this frozen minor erdtree is located above the cave of the forlorn. you can get here by making your way up the snowy ridges or using the waygate on the eastern hill above the albinauric rise. a putrid avatar guards this minor erdtree. try using a flame-based attack or weapon for this fight, as erdtree avatars and the putrid-variant are weak to fire. it will drop the ruptured crystal tear upon defeat. another unmarked location, the inner consecrated snowfield, spans across the region's epicenter. from the same site of grace, cross the frozen river until you get to the consecrated snowfield map stele. there is a smithing stone 8 you can grab from a corpse behind the large tree. get closer to the frozen river; there should be a pack of wolves chasing what seems to be an invisible teardrop scarab. kill them and the scarab to get the ash of war - white shadow's lure . from there, head slightly west until an npc invasion trigger. anastasia, tarnished-eater is the same npc invader in limgrave and on the road leading to mt. gelmir. this fight will be the last time you come across her—she drops a somber ancient dragon smithing stone upon defeat. from where you've found the second moving caravan, ride west, and you'll soon find the yelough anix ruins. before exploring the ruins, go southeast, where the giant snow pillar is located. you can hear the singing of an ancestral follower nearby; follow the sound until you find two of them guarding a body that holds the stalwart horn charm +1. go back to the yelough anix ruins and head to the middle structure. there is an underground entrance that's surrounded by walls from all sides. there are two ways to get in. the underground chamber contains the unendurable frenzy sorcery—the same spell the trolls guarding the ruins can use. from the underground room, make your way up and go to the northernmost building. a small structure contains a stonesword key surrounded by a few frenzied rats. you can reach this unmarked location by riding straight north from the yelough anix ruins. west consecrated snowfield is a crucial location to access mohgwyn palace, an underground area located beneath caelid. as you get closer to the giant pillar in the middle of this location, you will be invaded by npc invader noble sanguine. not only will he drop the complete sanguine noble set, but he will also activate the nearby waygate that allows you to teleport to mohgwyn palace. the waygate is west of the invasion, below two sloped broken pillars. the apostate derelict is located on the northwestern tip of the consecrated snowfield. from where you fought the sanguine noble npc invader, head north until you see the wandering mausoleum. this wandering mausoleum will shoot magical artilleries at its surrounding area, making the journey to the apostate derelict much more challenging. try taking down the wandering mausoleum as soon as possible. thankfully, its skull deposits are located on its legs, allowing you to hide from its magic attacks right underneath it. there is not much to do inside the apostate derelict, despite it being the last church in the game. inside lies phillia, a giant albinauric woman who's the final destination for latenna's questline . summon latenna's spirit ashes, and after the brief dialogue, you'll obtain a somber ancient dragon smithing stone. you can find the silver mirrorshield from inside the destroyed church as well. there is a death rite bird roaming boss at the head of the frozen river to the church's east that spawns at nightfall. it drops the explosive ghostflame sorcery upon defeat. to get to ordina, you'll want to port to the inner consecrated snowfield site of grace and head north until you get to the town's site of grace. ordina, liturgical town, has a puzzle that requires you to enter an evergaol and light candles on four statues located around the town to access its secret. it is highly recommended to equip the sentry's torch before exploring ordina, as it allows you to see invisible enemies roaming the town. you can purchase one from the hermit merchant in the capital outskirts for 7000 runes. you don't have to have the required stats for the sentry's torch's effect to work. you could also equip the torch and dual-wield your right-hand weapon, and the torch's effect would still function. using soft cotton or the black knife set can help you maneuver your way into the town more quietly. the latter is located below the long staircase that leads from the evergaol to the sealed room. the sealed room contains a waygate that will teleport you to the beginning of miquella's haligtree . reward: somber smithing stone 8 you can find this scarab on a relatively large rock pillar northeast of the consecrated snowfield site of grace. it's a short distance away from where you can find the nomadic warrior's cookbook 23 . reward: ash of war - white shadow's lure this scarab is located across the frozen river from the inner consecrated snowfield site of grace. you can a pack of wolves chasing it around while invisible. reward: somber smithing stone 7, somber smithing stone 8, somber smithing stone 9 just west of the region's minor erdtree, there are three teardrop scarabs you can find atop some rock formations. you can get on top of these rocks by using torrent or you can simply hit the scarabs with range spells/arrows/etc. /n the subterranean shunning-grounds is an expansive dungeon found underneath the legacy dungeon of leyndell, royal capital - located in the altus plateau region of elden ring. while its structure behave similarly to the legacy dungeon above, it is not required to proceed through the royal capital, and houses key characters and events necessary to obtain certain endings. this page contains information on the location, walkthrough , and guide to traverse this area, locate all of its treasure, and tips to defeat the enemies within. looking for a particular section of this page? click one of the links below to jump to... how to get to the subterranean shunning-grounds subterranean shunning-grounds

shunning-grounds is a high level optional area located below the legacy dungeon itself of lenydell, royal capital. though you can access it at any time when exploring the capital, you may find the enemies within much tougher than those above ground, so for this reason we recommend that you hold off on exploring it until you have completed the royal capital, and possibly even completed the giant's forge if you are still having trouble with the enemies in these sewers. it's highly recommended that you have a weapon with +22 or a special weapon at +9 to be able to deal enough damage. to reach the sewers beneath leyndell earlier, head to the avenue balcony site of grace in the middle of the capital just off the main road that runs through it. go down the stairs to the lower northern ruined part of the city and stick to the left side as you advance to take out the three leyndell knights. once they've been dealt with, look over the balcony to the left off in the northwest side of the ruined city streets. among the rubble you should be able to spot a lone well in the shadow of the large dragon wing, guarded by the fast-crawling enemies seen in the volcano manor. head down into the well using the ladder. once down in the well, you may want to activate a lantern if you have one to help with visibility. loot the body holding a rune arc and open the gate to the left. keep heading down the corridors and down the ladders and stairs until you reach a long tunnel full of giant rats, and be ready to block or dodge their lunging attacks, though most won't attack too quickly. the path under the stairs leads to bars you can't get through, so move forward to find 6 poisonbone dart on a body surrounded by rats, then open the far door to reach this new area. as you enter these forgotten sewers, you'll be standing on high ledge overlooking a main pathway below. the good news is a site of grace lies just below you, but so too does one of the three omen patrolling this long hall. since he's watching the ladder down from your vantage point, ranged builds may want to begin attacking the omen from the high point, while melee attackers can either drop off to the right and sneak up, or perform a jumping attack from above. you may have fought omen before, but make no mistake - these are extremely high level and will deal a ton of damage to you if their blows connect. certain heavier weapons can cause them to stagger, but their kicks and raised fist attacks absorb most recoil, which means you'll want to be ready to dodge or block them instead of trading blows. they can also spew out cones of holy fire that have impressive reach but little width - so strafing around them to attack is key. if they raise their arms wide, be ready to get out of the way of their running grab attack, which can be heavily delayed for an extremely quick grab animation. after touching the site of grace in the small room to the northwest, you'll find the door opposite locked, as well as the two large gates on either side of the hall. two more omen can be spotted at the far side - one of them will patrol from side to side near a golden rune 11 and a body holding bloodsoaked manchettes and bloodsoaked mask - while the other patrols the length of the hall slowly, giving you time to take them on separately and hopefully get off backstabs to start the fight. with all the omen in the hall cleared, you'll have two wings of the sewer to clear that link to the large gates - the northeast tunnels, and the large southwest pipe room. we recommend clearing out the southwest first. look along the east wall past the locked door and site of grace for a ladder in a recess you can slide down to arrive in a very large sewer pipe room, with pipes criss-crossing the large area crawling with fanged imps, and a long drop to the sewer floor where giant crayfish roam. grab the freezing grease to the left as you enter the room, and advance extremely cautiously - as fanged imps wait along the pipes to jump down or crawl up to ambush you on all sides. while one patrols the pipe in front of you, wait for it to head away before jumping to the pipe and getting ready to ward off an attack from above. these fanged imps hit hard and fast with bleed, but are highly susceptible to recoiling from a shield block where you can follow up with a quick guard counter - so long as you take them on one at a time. grab the 10 serpent arrow on a body, and look for one hanging from a pipe above and knock it down with a ranged attack. once its dead, cautiously advance up the pipe to take on the imp patrolling. another will climb up where the pipe curves left before a large platform. you'll want to advance cautiously to the large platform - one imp will break out from behind some boxes, while two more wait to crawl up on either side, and a third hangs from the pipes above in the middle. try to trigger them one by one with ranged attacks, or rush them as they climb since they'll be locked in that animation until safely on the ground. grab the 5 fire grease in the middle of the large platform before moving right along the pipes, and you'll probably spot an imp along the far wall hurling daggers at you. don't get distracted, because another imp may drop down from the end of the pipe path off to the right - kill that one first and loot the somber smithing stone 6 at the end of the pipe's platform, then head south to reach the far side of the room with the last fanged imp. grab the smithing stone 7 to the right of the doorway before heading up through the tunnel. the room beyond has a lever to open one of the large gates in the main hallway - but you also need to watch out for an ambush on the left from another omen. this omen is a supercharged version of the others you'll face, sporting more growths and horns. in addition to blasting you with cones of holy fire, it may charge up in battle to explode in more holy fire, sending several orbs that will track in your direction. even after this attack, it will be bathed in holy fire that augments its attack power, so be wary and don't get too greedy getting your hits in. dodge around the large attacks to follow up with your own and try to stagger it when it's not punching or kicking. once this omen is dead, ensure the gate is raised and grab the shadow bait incantation in front of the statue. before you turn your attention to the northeast tunnels, there's one more thing to do back in the previous room. return to the large pipe room and look below the exit to find another large pipe running down below, and jump down to it, then drop down to the floor far below (you'll take a bit of falling damage unless you use soft cotton). down here there are only two enemies guarding a host of treasures, but the giant crayfish are an absolute pain to deal with, especially when you don't have torrent to outpace them on. while you can take them on one at a time, you may find a viable strategy in pitting them against each other. run to the side past a small half-buried pipe to trigger one of the giant crayfish to rise up, then run left to grab the attention of the second. from here, use the half-buried pipe as a way to block them from advancing upon you, sticking around the back where there's less space to move (don't go inside the pipe - they can and will skewer you through it). if done correctly, you can run back and forth towards them to trigger their slams and swipes that will damage the other crayfish - and they'll likely deal far more damage per hit than you will. stay mobile and be ready to run between open sections if they come around to one side, and eventually one of them should die by the other's hand. that will allow you to fight a hopefully weakened crayfish and take it out before it can grab and skewer you. once both giant crayfish are finally dead, look around the room to loot 5 glass shard , somber smithing stone 7 , 4 smithing stone 7 , and the incredibly important mohg's shackle . you can also spot a scarab hiding in the other buried pipe for an additional somber smithing stone 7 . to get out from the depths, look around the south corner of the room for a hole in the wall. this branches into two paths - one of which surprisingly leads to its own mini-dungeon, the lenydell catacombs (see the walkthrough for it here) . the other path leads to a lift back up, where you'll come across a group of spectral crossbow-toting foot soldiers who just don't seem to die. quickly look to the right of the stairs up for a section of wall you can roll into to reveal an illusory wall hiding yet another spectral soldier - but that's not all. roll into the corner on the left, and you'll find the culprit - a spirit-calling snail that keeps summoning these enemies. kill it to end them for good, and you can get the haligdrake talisman +1 that it guards. take the path above down a hall to find a golden rune 11 , and a lever that reveals a secret path back to the gate you previously raised. now it's time to clear a path to the other main gate via the northeast tunnel, which you can find by looking for an open floor section in front of the far gate. drop through the floor grate into a narrow tunnel full of giant rats. one side has a dead end with a few aggressive rats and preserving boluses , while the other path has more fairly docile rats, ending with a pipe tunnel entrance on the right, and another hallway to the left. head back to the rat-infested hall and take the pipe tunnel on the northeast wall. these tight confines are full of slugs lining the walls - but thankfully most are docile and can just be swatted away. be sure to have your lantern out, as there are a few pitfalls to look out for. right after the first group of slugs is a hole in the floor leading to a lower pipe, but you may as well take this path first, as it leads down to a small section of a larger chamber where three revenants guard a stonesword key , and you can unlock a door from this side back to the pipe tunnels leading back up. past the first hole is the side path down to the previously mentioned chamber, so instead take the main path to pick up a glass shard and follow the pipe tunnel right but beware of another hole - as this one will drop you in the larger part of the chamber you found earlier to be surrounded by enemies. instead, jump over the hole to grab 10 rainbow stone arrow , and then take a left at the fork in the tunnel to reach the large chamber. after taking out the two nearest revenants, stay along the left wall and leap over the dung mounds to quickly run down the other two revenants in the large room, because a revenant lord is about to appear in the middle, and fighting in close quarters can be very tricky with this opponent. use holy magic if possible, and unleash a powerful attack while it's still crawling up from the depths. always try to strafe around it, as its frontal assaults are hard to withstand even with a lot of stamina. defeating it will earn you a ghost glovewort 6' , and you can search the chamber to also find a smithing stone 7 and 5 grave violet . back in the pipe tunnel take the path through the open gate door to find a it littered with slugs - some of which will try to ambush you from a small alcove on the right that holds fireproof drived liver . as you head down the far tunnel and leave the pipes behind, you'll be in some trouble - the next room has a small ladder with an omen at the top who will bellyflop down to meet you, and soon after, another omen will come wandering this way. you'll need to immediately engage this omen (who can also supercharge with holy fire) before his friend can back him up, and if it seems like backup is arriving, you may have to retreat into the tunnels and sprint away from holy fire blasts to run and gun until you can defeat both the omen - as engaging them both head on will often end badly. once defeated, grab the somber smithing stone 8 in the middle of the room before climbing up, and carefully sneak into the room to find the lever for the second large gate for the main hallway, as well as a third omen standing by a statue. make sure you open the gate first in case things go badly, then engage the last omen and claim the smithing stone 7 he was guarding. with both gates open, it's now time to head through a new passage past the gate on the east side of the hallway to the right of the statue. open the door to enter the balcony of a large circular cistern. it may seem like in impossible drop down, and the path to the right only has a few putrid zombies and a body holding a grace mimic , but don't worry. look left as you enter the cistern and follow the shimmering sound to drop down the ledge near you to find another path below, along with a scarab you can kill for a somber smithing stone 6 . head down to the end of the path to find some string by another zombie, then turn right into a passageway to leave the cistern behind. grab the nearby warming stone , and then make your way through the hallway lined with putrid zombies until you come to a longer room with stairs down to some poison plants. before checking the path under the stairs, you can look below next to a body holding 2 fire grease to find a blighted bloom miranda plant, which is flanked by three basilisks hiding behind it. because of the close confines its easy to get death blighted if you aren't fast, so you may want to consider sniping them from above first, or dropping down and taking the poison damage to focus on killing the basilisks first. look for 8 poisoned stone in the corner before moving down the hall and be wary of a few more basilisks at another lower balcony in the cistern where you can find nomad ashes . head back up the ladder and look for a passage under the stairs with some preserving boluses , for a tunnel with yet more basilisks and a commoner by a locked door. at the end of the tunnel you'll find yourself in the bottom of another pipe room, with an omen at the other side. it will turn to face left, so you can sneak around to the right and get in a backstab - just be ready for it to explode with holy fire. you'll have a lot of room to maneuver and no other enemies to worry about, so take your time with this fight. defeating this omen will reward you with a special omen bairn item, and you can find several bodies along the floor to find 2 golden centipede , 4 glass shard , and dappled white cured meat . climbing up the ladder on the far side, you won't be able to jump to the raised pipe in the middle, so exit through the other doorway to find yourself back in the main pipe room crawling with fanged imps. you'll be on a higher platform along with a body holding 3 poisoned stone , and the door across the bridge leads back to the main entrance hall and the site of grace. from this raised area in the large pipe room, look for another sloping pipe and be wary of more fanged imps looking to crawl up from the sides of the pipes. the path leads to a long pipe with fanged imps on all sides - so try to lure them at you one at a time so you don't get swarmed. once you get to the end of the pipe, drop off either side to the lower platform and be ready for more imps to be coming your way. be careful about falling on the lower pipe here, as more imps are waiting to ambush you while you head up to the door on the right that has a golden rune 10 . the door up ahead leads to the previous pipe room that has a ladder you can kick down on the side, and hole in the center of the pipe you can enter. these pipes can get extremely confusing, as its a maze of different passages and various teardrop scarabs. to advance, you need only chase the giant rat down the southeast path, but if you want to explore the pipe maze, you can find a golden rune 8 , 4 smithing stone 7 , smithing stone 8 , warming stone , and an eye of yelough . chasing the giant rat down the tunnel will lead to a fork with a golden rune 11 , but don't take the straight path as there's a hole just up ahead. go left first to find the smaller rat, and jump over another hole until you find a larger rat in front of the hole. then back track to the earlier hole to drop down to find yourself on the other side of the locked door where the commoner was standing. head the opposite direction to exit the tunnels into a chamber with several living jars. rush the largest one in the corner to defeat it before it can wake and spin at you, then clean up the smaller ones before looting a ritual pot . from here you can take a long lift to the bottom of the cistern where the forsaken depths site of grace is - as well as a boss fight that looms ahead. mohg may be an omen just like margit/margott, but their attacks are very different, and due to the high difficulty level of this area, getting hit may take huge chunks out of your health. it's highly recommended you take a +8 or +9 spirit summon into battle with you that can divert mohg's attention - all the better if that summon can dish out heavy attacks like the mimic tear, kaiden sellsword, or some of the legendary knight summons. it's also highly recommended that you craft some stanching boluses to deal with a lot blood loss you may experience in this fight - especially if you haven't invested too much points into vigor and have lower than average hp. mohg deals primarily in attacks that deal "bloodflame" damage, meaning many of his attacks will deal both fire damage and cause bleed buildup - even if you block. some of his attacks may even leave pools of fiery blood on the ground that will hit you if you cross over it after the attack has landed. mobility is key for this fight, as staying in one place will just saturate you and you'll likely burn or hemorrhage before long. while mohg carries a large trident, many of the attacks you'll need to watch out for are more magical in nature. he can summon a portal of blood to reach into and pull lots of magic out of: if he reaches up into a portal in front of him, he'll toss out a huge swath of bloodflame in front of him to saturate the area. if you're already close to him, he may just rain down blood from a portal overhead to soak the area right in front of him with bloodflame. if he rends the very air with his claws to create a flame trail, back off immediately or face an explosion of flame magic directly in front of him. he can also do this after planting his trident down, ending his rend with a quick explosion that has less delay than the other attack. other than that, you can expect mogh to vary up these bloodflame attacks with more standard swings, sweeps, and frontal slams with his trident. these attacks are all very slow and telegraphed, and thankfully doesn't delay strikes like margit/morgott do. because of this, you can usually block or dodge these strikes straight on and follow up with quick hits between his 2-3 combo attacks. if you have mogh's shackle, you'll find that it works exactly like margit's shackle - using it will bind him to the spot for a sizeable moment, allowing both you and your spirit summon to unleash your strongest attacks that he won't be able to dodge. if you time it right, you can follow up your sustained hits with another few strong attacks to possibly stagger him, letting you land a critical strike just after he regains his movement. the item can be used twice in the fight, and will then have no effect. between using the shackle and having your spirit summon direct his sweeping attacks and bloodflame away from your direction, you should find plenty of opportunity to unleash strong attacks and stagger mohg between stunning him. defeating his boss will earn you the bloodflame talons incantation - but that's not all. a chest at the front of the main altar holds the erdtree's favor +1 , and if you strike the altar with your weapon, it will move back into a recess to reveal a secret path that can only be traversed once you have defeated morgott in leyndell, royal capital. after defeating morgott, you can return to the altar past mohg to find the seal gone, and a large open crypt with a very long shaft surrounded by the corpses of nomads - much like the ones you've been buy items from this whole game. among the corpses here you can also find some yellow ember - but be wary as you cross the narrow wooden plank to the other side - not all nomads are dead. as you reach the opposite platform, you can probably hear some of them playing their strange instruments - but those sitting ones blending in amongst the dead won't attack unless provoked - but one wandering up from the nearby stairs will. these nomads seem to have no eyes left and attack haltingly and move very slowly. while the deal little damage with their strange instruments, they are extremely deadly thanks to their frenzied flame attacks. once they start casting them to shoot beams of madness-inducing fire in large arcs around them, its hard to stop or stagger them, so you'll need to be quick and decisive in your strikes, or fight at long distance. be sure to let the first nomad hit the ruined structure against the far wall, as you'll find the nomadic merchant's chapeau , nomadic merchant's finery , and nomadic merchant's trousers in the corner, as well as 5 grace mimic nearby not trapped under any structures. head down the stairs on the other side carefully to find another wandering nomad among the dead, and a structure against the left wall he can destroy with his frenzied flames. there's also another nomad playing music along the ledge, but won't join the fight unless you strike him. grab the 5 eye of yelough hiding behind the structure, and if this nomad gives you trouble, you can try sneaking up behind him. there's another narrow beam crossing the pit here you can take down to a ledge filled with rubble and a golden rune 11 , and then drop down to another perpendicular beam below to find the frenzied's cookbook 2 on one end, and a music-playing nomad on the other near a body holding 3 hefty beast bone , but the path stops here - and things are about to get more difficult in terms of platforming. you'll need to carefully drop down the shaft using what little platforms you can find in the stone coffins that are jutting out along the edges of the pit. there are lots of ways you can attempt this task, some are easier than others - but using items that lessen or negate fall damage won't help if you hit the bottom. we recommend jumping to the west set of coffins first and drop down among the group towards the southeast corner. once you reach the corner, double back and jump down to the northwest corner, and then turn to the northeast corner. this is the hardest part, as you can see three sets of coffins above one another on middle of the the east wall, and the coffin at bottom has a body holding an item - your ultimate destination. trying to aim for the middle coffin will often end with you bouncing off the edge of the top coffin and falling to your death, so take a running jump to reach the top middle coffin, then look for another one lower down in the southeast corner. if successful, you can skip the middle coffin and jump down to the lowest one holding the inescapable frenzy incantation, and you'll find a safe path to tread once more. there's another structure here hiding an item, so turn around to find a small dark hallway leading to sitting nomad guarding a fingerprint stone shield . hit the sitting nomad once to get him to rise, and let him chase you back to the tent to destroy it with his frenzied flames, and under it you'll find a note - miquella's needle . as you head down to the lowest point next to a music playing nomad, there's nowhere else to go but to the end of the pit, but thankfully this time you won't die from fall damage. instead, dropping down will cause the floor to shatter and lead you all the way down to the frenzied flame proscription. interestingly enough, with the floor broken, you can now jump all the way down from the top of the shaft and no longer take fall damage. here you'll find the creepy burned door leading to the three fingers of the frenzied flame - but the door won't just open for anyone. if you helped the maiden hyetta along through liurnia by giving her shabriri grapes, she'll be here now to the side, and give you the clue you need to meet with the three fingers - divest yourself of your possessions, and they will surely welcome you. by interacting the door while naked, your character will pry it open, despite the frenzied flames. the cutscene inside will leave your character forever marked by the frenzied flame, and returning to hyetta will have you seal your pact by giving hyetta the flame of chaos inside you. after talking to her a final time, she'll leave you with the frenzied flame seal and 5 frenzyflame stone . when you go to rest at the nearby site of grace, melina will disavow you and will part ways with you for good, giving you a grim warning as she does so. /n mohgwyn palace is an optional region you can find in the siofra river region of the underground in elden ring. this late-game region contains the mohgwyn dynasty mausoleum , home to a powerful optional boss who drops a great rune and remembrance. this page will contain walkthrough and guide information on how to reach mohgwyn palace, all the treasures and items that can be found inside, tips for navigating the region, and how to defeat the area boss. how to get to mohgwyn palace mohgwyn palace walkthrough dynasty mausoleum entrance mohg, lord of blood boss fight if you have already collected the two halves of the haligtree secret medallion and gained access to the secret region in the mountaintops of the giants reaching mohgwyn's palace is as easy as using a teleporter. this teleporter is located at the spot marked on the map above. simply teleport to the inner consecrated snowfield site of grace then ride west until you reach the cliff's edge. look around until you see an albinauric and a bloodied teleporter. pass through the teleporter and you will find yourself in a pitch black cave. walk forward to exit the cave and find yourself on a cliff overlooking mohgwyn's palace. walk along the cliff edge outside the cave until you reach the end, where you should see a pillar below you. drop to the pillar, then down to ground level from there. turn around and go back up the hill where you will find a golden rune [11] on a body. turn around again and head down the hill to find the palace approach ledge-road site of grace. look down the path near the site of grace and you will see a small army of albinaurics hanging out on the cliffside. the white flesh albinaurics are non-aggressive and actually give a good amount of runes, offering a good opportunity to farm some runes if you need them. but you need to watch out for the red flesh albinaurics who can roll into you with a high-speed kartwheel for massive damage, and fire spikes into the area around themselves. if you see one kartwheeling toward you the best move is just to dodge into them and they will roll right through. try to aggro them one at a time if you can, you do not want multiple of these guys rolling around at once. once all the enemies are dead you can grab the golden rune [11] from the body among the albinaurics. continue down the path and around the corner where you will encounter a group of the red albinaurics on patrol. again, try to take them on one by one if you can, but if not just create some distance between yourself and the group and let them come to you naturally. once they are all dead you can grab the smithing stone [6] and bloodrose x5 off the nearby bodies. from here we are going to duck into the half-hidden path to the left, just behind the gravestones. follow it to the end where you will fall off a ledge and into the blood swamp below. go directly ahead and you will encounter one of those giant crows which looks to be covered in scarlet rot. these are the most dangerous foes in this area and they are a few of them nearby, so engage them one by one and be very careful. for the most part you want to stay underneath them or slightly off to the side which will allow you to avoid most of the crow's pecking attacks. the most punishable attack is the crow's dive attack, in which it slides along the ground while snapping its mouth wildly. stay away until its writhing subsides, then you can run in and get a bunch of free attacks. after killing this first one you can grab the rot grease x3 off the body under the cliff just ahead, then look to your left where you will see another body hanging off the ledge, holding onto the nomadic warrior's cookbook 24 . also a quick reminder before we start properly exploring this area, you can ride torrent here! saddle up anytime you need to escape or move quickly across the swamp. follow along the ledge and you will come up to a giant broken statue with a bloodrose x5 sitting at the feet. nearby is a rock platform with some scarlet rot infected dogs on it, but as you approach you will be invaded by a nameless white mask so step away to make sure you don't attract the attention of the dogs while being invaded. these guys can be kind of tough because of their quick dagger attacks and oppressive blood magic. try not to get caught up in the bug swarm spell he sends out, especially not when the white mask is attacking you at the same time. they are quick moving but still susceptible to the occasional guard counter. your reward for defeating the invader will be a furlcalling finger remedy , white mask , and the war surgeon armor set . from here you will want to kill the aforementioned group of dogs to prevent them from chasing you around as you explore. if you continue walking along the cliff wall you will eventually wander into a grassy clearing among some trees with an item in it. as you attempt to grab the item another giant crow will ambush you so be careful. kill the crow to claim the item, a stonesword key . from here head into the graveyard on the opposite side of the grassy opening where you can loot the haligdrake talisman +2 off one of the gravestones. look to the right and you will see another giant crow pecking at an item. kill this crow, then grab the holy grease it was guarding. kill the next group of dogs on the platform in front of you, but beware the giant crow that will join in on the battle when you get close. you will want to run away to try and split the enemies up a bit before engaging. to the left of this platform you will see an opening in the cliff wall. head over there where you will encounter some more dogs and find an arteria leaf x4. exit the cliff path and keep following along with the wall on your left. ahead you will see a path leading toward a nwe area of the swamp, full of red albinaurics. we don't want to go there just yet, so instead look to the right where you will see an item in the middle of the blood swamp, along the blood fountains. dodge the eruptions of blood coming out of the ground and grab the item, a smithing stone [6], then grab the golden rune [13] hiding behind the nearby pillar. look around and you will notice a rocky platform to the east with a golden tree on it. walk over and jump up on the rock and kill the dogs quickly because you are about to be invaded by another nameless white mask. deal with this one in the same way you did the previous invader and you will be rewarded with another furlcalling finger remedy . with the enemies cleared out you can freely grab the golden seed from under the tree. with the seed in hand we are done with this section of the swamp, so hop on torrent and head back to that path with the albinaurics we avoided earlier. as soon as you step onto this path you will see a body with clarifying boluses on it to the right and you will be invaded by yet another nameless white mask. killing this one will get you yet another furlcalling finger remedy . keep moving forward where you will see what appears to be another giant crow, but it is just a corpse. carefully deal with the small group of red albinaurics lounging around behind the crow corpse. go to the right side of the giant tree in front of you where you will see an even larger group of red albinaurics circling around a tree, and a smithing stone [8] on a body leaning up against the base of the tree. i highly recommend using an ash summon here to help distract some of these enemies as you battle them otherwise you are about to become the focus of about a dozen kartwheeling warriors. kill them all and you can claim the blood-tainted excrement x8 near the bonfire on the left, as well as the hero's rune [3], drawstring blood grease x4, and another blood-tainted excrement x8 from the base of the tree they were circling. from here look east and you should see a small cave with some albinaurics hanging around outside of it. these are non-aggressive enemies so kill them freely then head into the cave where you will find the swarm of flies spell. exit the cave and go immediately left to find another small cave, this one with an ash scarab inside. kill the scarab to receive ash of war: blood tax , then grab the smithing stone [9] sitting nearby. just be careful of any nearby albinaurics that may follow you in and try to corner you. walk out of the cave and you will see another small albinauric camp straight ahead. kill whatever enemies are still around, then loot the hero's rune [4] sitting near their stone altar. you may see another path to the south, but that actually leads back to the site of grace we started at, so instead hop on torrent and head north towards that grassy area we ignored earlier. as you step onto the grass you will see a red albinauric with a giant horn. you want to rush him as quickly as you can and kill him, before he can summon the giant ghost skeleton you see above. grab the smithing stone [7] and golden rune [12] nearby. there are actually four of these albinaurics hiding in this area, and each will summon one skeleton. these skeletons can fire deadly lasers and knock you over with powerful arm sweeps. needless to say, we don't want them around for long. follow along the right side wall to find one hidden behind some trees. another can be found standing in the middle of the clearing, and the final albinauric is standing on top of a giant tree stump on the northwest corner of the area. these enemies have large healthpools and are a minor threat themselves due to their heavy attacks. this is a good area for some horseback combat if you are confident in your ability to execute good hit and run tactics, but as always it becomes incredibly deadly if you get caught out and knocked off of torrent. once they are all dead you can grab the loot lying around the area, including a golden rune [12], sacramental bud , nascent butterfly x3, and a rune arc in the alcove near where the first summoner was standing. once the area is clear you can proceed to the mausoleum behind the summoners where you will find the map: mohgwyn palace . head up the nearby stairs where you can activate and rest at the dynasty mausoleum entrance site of grace. head up the stairs near the site of grace where you will encounter a few zombies. when killed, these zombies explode and leave behind a cloud that causes bleed buildup. they are all over this area, but most of them are not aggressive so you can mostly ignore them if you want. run past the first group and up the next set of stairs where you will encounter even more zombies. walk right past them and grab the smithing stone [7] on the tombstone to the right of the path. keep heading up the path, ignoring all the zombies as you go unless they lunge at you. when you reach the third clearing look to the left and you will see a body with an item hanging over the cliff. walk over and loot the body to get the numen's rune . get back on the path and keep moving forward and up the set of stairs that winds around the mountainside. at the top of these stairs you will encounter a giant slime enemy. this foe has a large health pool but it is also mostly stationary and its attacks don't do that mcuh damage. wear it down with whatever damage type you have (bleed works well) and step back anytime it wells up and prepares for its stab attack. kill it and you will find stanching boluses x3 on a body behind. just past the slime you will see a split in the path on your left. follow the path to the end where you will find another large group of zombies and a stonesword key . grab the key and head back to the main path. follow it to the end where you will find an entrance to a cave, and a bloodrose x8 on a body near some tombstones. equip a lantern or torch and head into the cave. follow the path on the left and you will soon run into a blood mage who rises out of the ground. dealing with his long range jab attacks and area blood magic can be annoying in this small area, so just keep your shield up and step back anytime he summons his blood swamp on the ground. if he holds his dagger up and sword sideways he is waiting to parry, so be sure not to use any melee attacks during that period. instead wait for one of his melee attacks and guard counter it until you can get a topple and easy kill. go left at the split path to find a merchant who sells some potentially useful items like rune arc and stonesword key , but if you don't need anything take the path to the right to proceed. you will step into a larger room and see an item directly in front of you leaning up against a tomb stone. loot the item to receive a lord's rune . go to the right of the tombstone and in the back corner you will find a large pit that is full of zombies and one great ghost glovewort . you can just jump down into the pit, grab the glovewort, then run out before the zombies have time to react. return to the tombstone where we got the lord's rune and this take follow the path on the left side. be sure to look behind you where you will see an item glowing in the corner of the cave, a smithing stone [8]. a blood mage will spawn behind you as you grab the item. turn back around and head up the path ahead of you, following it all the way up where you will find the cave exit and the dynasty mausoleum midpoint site of grace. although this is called the midpoint, it is basically just a few steps to the boss room. go up the nearby stairs and you will find yourself looking at a sort of open air chapel where a large number of the red albinaurics are worshipping in front of one of the blood mages. if you have any sort of strong area of effect attack now is the time to use it, as you want to thin the numbers of these enemies as much as possible as quick as possible. mostly, just don't let them overwhelm you and don't be afraid to run away if needed. kill all of the enemies and you can freely loot the chest on the altar to receive a somber ancient smithing stone (then check behind the altar where you will find a golden rune [13]. when you are ready for the area boss battle, use the elevator opposite the altar to be lifted up to the top of the mountain. walk into the large temple ahead and you will encounter... mohg, lord of blood is one of the toughest optional bosses in elden ring . he has powerful and far reaching physical attacks, mixed magic and physical damage, and many bleed inflicting spells, and that is before you even reach his much more powerful second phase. to prepare you will want high defense and a good 100% physical block shield. also consider some defensive talismans, like the dragoncrest shield talisman or pearldrake talisman . if you battled mohg in the subterranean shunning grounds you will already be familiar with this phase of the battle, but if not here is a little refresher: if he claws the area in front of him a small explosion will appear after a delay. wait a beat then dodge roll backwards to avoid the damage. if he reaches behind and charges up the spell the explosion will be bigger but focused directly in front of him, making it easy to side step and strike him a few time. if you are far out of melee range, he will summon a magic rune above him, reach into it, then quickly fling a wave of blood at you. you can avoid this by simply rolling toward the blood as it is flying toward you. if he reaches into that same magic rune and holds his hand there for a second or two he is about to summon his blood rain. you can punish this attack with one or two hits from behind, but once the blood actually starts raining you need to step back to avoid getting caught in the damage cone. almost all of mohg's melee combos are three hits long, so make sure you aren't trying to punish or guard counter until the very end of the sequence. be even more careful of the ground stab, which has a second hitbox when he pulls the spear out of the ground. the most punishable attacks are the overhead slam and forward thrust. both of these can be dodged by simply rolling into him before the weapon makes impact, allowing for a few hits before he will follow up. upon taking 15-20% of his health in damage, mohg will thrust his spear into the air and do a diagonal slash which can be avoid by simply strafing to his offhand side or behind. even if you avoid this attack a blood ring will appear around your character. he will do this each time he loses 15-20% of his health, until you have three rings on you. at this point he will activate the rings, causing three instances of highly damaging bleed that restore mohg's health. you basically need to chug flasks between the instances of bleed to survive, then get ready for phase two against the newly refreshed mohg. even if you don't have the damage or execution required to kill mogh in phase one it is still a good idea to try and maximize your phase one damage because that will mean he starts with less health in phase two, meaning less time you have to phase this hellish foe. in phase two mohg grows wings, his attacks gain even more bleed and magic damage properties, and he starts mixing in some new attacks. his base moveset remains mostly the same, except now his melee swings fling blood that deals extra damage and he likes to fly around in the air when casting spells. if you are using a shield you just have to eat this damage and stay on top of health management between his combos. he seems to be a bit more unrelenting here as well, so it will be harder to create distance and heal when needed. some new additions: the thrust attack now has a second instance of damage where mohg twirls the spear to fling blood, and the explosion after the ground stab is bigger and even more damaging, so strafe around and get away from it by any means necessary. he also likes to mix in a long range, multi-hit thrust attack when you are far away, which he telegraphs by leaning back with both hands on his weapon, slightly flapping his wings, then dashing forward. it seems best to dodge to the side when you see this one coming. same goes for his uppercut into ground slam, which ends in a similar explosion to the ground stab. it is tempting to try and punish, but it is best to just stay back. so that all sounds pretty dangerous, so when do you hit him? like usual, the move is to wait for the overhead slam attacks. if you stand outside his melee range you can tempt him into two highly punishable attacks: his long range slam where he holds his spear by the very end and slams it down in front of him. dodge roll forward and you can get in a few easy hits. there is another variation of his where he jumps into the air before slamming the spear down, similar concept, similarly punishable. the other is his flying uppercut into thrust. this is the thrust that does not result in a ground stab explosion. dodge into him as he comes down to ground level and you can get in some more free attacks. and of course, you can still get in a hit or two when he casts the blood rain or claw explosion, if you are quick enough to avoid the hitboxes. all in all, it's a hard fight but one that can be simplified with the right approach. never stay in his melee range too long or you may just get caught in his blender of melee attacks and die to stray bleed damage. instead run away and bait out his slower attacks for slow building damage (funny enough, you will notice bleed weapons work really well on him). defeat mohg and you will be rewarded with the remembrance of the blood lord and mohg's great rune . /n miquella's haligtree is an optional legacy dungeon you can encounter in the secret northern area in elden ring . it is a massive tree with powerful enemies and great treasures that is meant for late game players. this page will contain walkthrough and guide information on how to reach the haligtree, all the treasures and items that can be found inside, tips for navigating the dungeon, and how to defeat the area boss. how to get to miquella's haligtree miquella's haligtree walkthrough haligtree town haligtree town plaza loretta, knight of the haligtree boss fight haligtree promenade first things first, you need access to the miquella's haligtree region, only accessible by obtaining both halves of the haligtree secret medallion and using it at the grand lift of rold . to complete this step, use our how to access elden ring's secret region guide page. the lift will take you to the hidden path to the haligtree dungeon, which you can quickly pass through to get outside into the consecrated snowfield . because of the snowstorm in this area it is difficult to navigate, but you can follow the glowing spots along the ground to find your way out safely, or just ride directly north until you get out. once you are in the clear proceed to this spot just north of the river where you can find the area map. continue north from the map stele and you will find ordina, liturgical town . the teleporter to the miquella's haligtree dungeon is hidden here, but we need to pass a trial before we can proceed. make sure you activate the site of grace at the front of the town before you take this challenge on. around town you will notice four of these strange altars, pictured above. one is at ground level in the middle of the town, and the other three are found upon the rooftops of different buildings around the town. climb onto the rooftops and note the locations of all four altars, and take note of the blue flame lanterns which mark the spots where you can find ladders that let you get onto the rooftops. once you know where all four altars are go to the northwest side of town where you will find an evergaol with a statue next to it. examine the statue to receive the hint: "light the four figures in the evergaol". entering the evergoal next to this statue will take you to an alternate instance of ordina where you cannot use torrent and there are a number of strong enemies. you need to light the four altars without dying to complete it. start with the one on the outskirts of town. jump out of the city and run around the outside of it, making your way to the western edge. there are invisible black knife assassins chasing after you, but as long as you keep running they shouldn't be able to get you. find the ladder on the outside of the building, and climb it to reach the first altar. drop down to the buildings below the altar. from here you can see the next ladder you need to reach. drop down into the snow once again and run straight ahead to the stairs. hop onto the railing and you can jump your way up to the ladder. climb up the ladder to reach the second altar. at this point you will start to be attacked by the rooftop archers. if you are ever near one be sure to kill them to make this section easier, but otherwise just keep track of their locations and dodge whenever one shoots at you. with the second altar lit drop down to the buildings below once again. from here the rooftops will connect you directly to the base of the next altar, so all you need to do is make your way over there while dodging the archers. climb the ladders and light the third altar. that leaves only the ground level altar in the middle of town. this one is the easiest to reach, just drop down to the building below you and cross over the rooftops to get on top of it. drop down to street level from there and light it to complete the evergaol challenge. once you have completed the trial the magic barrier blocking the staircase at the back of the town will fade away, allowing you to reach the teleporter inside which will take you directly to the legacy dungeon. activate and rest at the haligtree canopy site of grace ahead, then immediately go up the branch to the right where you will find a stonesword key at the end. look down and you will see a branch with a couple of envoys below you. drop down and kill the envoys, then grab the sacramental bud they were guarding. follow this branch and it will reconnect back to the main one where you will encounter a series of envoys standing near a ledge. they will ignore you, but go ahead and kill them all anyways. at the end of this branch look right and you will see another one beneath you, leading to a large envoy. drop down and go battle the envoy, being careful not to let him hit you back off the edge. once the envoy is defeated you can grab the golden rune [10] sitting next to it. head back up the branch you came down on and look down where you will see another branch and and three envoys below. drop down and battle the envoys, being extra careful with your footing on this thinner branch. once the envoys are defeated you can loot the prattling pate (my beloved) ] from atop the nearby mushrooms. from here follow the branch all the way down where it will connect to the largest branch in the middle. grab the warming stone x4 off the mushrooms at the end of this path here. go up the middle branch where you will encounter a large number of giant ants. they are pretty easy to beat, just hold up your shield, block their incoming attack, then guard counter or just spam attacks to stagger them. be careful not to get overwhelmed though, and keep an eye out for their powerful ranged attack. once the ants are dead you can head up the branch where you will see it split three different ways. start by taking the thinnest branch on the left side so we can deal with the annoying envoys that have been shooting at us this whole time. run along the path, dodging all the spells and projectiles being fired at you. kill the envoys blocking your path. at the second split make a quick detour to the right to grab the aeonian butterfly guarded by the small plant enemy, then turn around and make your way up to the thicker branch at the very top where the group of envoys reside. start by going left and killing the aforementioned group of envoys, then grab the preserving boluses off the mushrooms at the end of the branch. next, go to the other side of the branch where you will encounter a bunch of plant enemies, including one of the larger ones. if you can, craft some fire pots to throw at the large plant which will stun it momentarily. once all the plants are dead you are free to grab the fire grease x3 off the body nearby. look to the right and you will see another item at the end of a branch to your right. this thin branch splits off the middle of the larger one you are standing on, so backtrack a little to find where it connects and make your way over to the item, a stonesword key . make your way back to where the branch split in three. this time, go up the branch on the right toward the envoys at the end. grab the dappled cured meat along the way then kill the two envoys blocking your way forward. grab the smithing stone [8] off of the small branch to the left, then turn around and head back to the split path. now go forward up the middle branch. you will see an giant envoy waiting at the end of this branch. grab the golden rune [10] off the body along this path, then sneak up on the giant envoy. get the jump on it for some quick damage, then put your guard up and prepare to block its heavy slam attacks which threaten to blast you off the edge. block and guard counter for an easy topple into kill, then loot the envoy crown it was guarding. with all of those items in hand we are finally ready to progress. make your way all the way back down the main branch where we got the warming stone awhile back. in the distance you will see one of those giant envoys on a high branch. if you run down this branch the envoy will start shooting homing attacks at you. we don't want to deal with that, so instead we are going to drop off the right side onto a smaller branch below. start running along this branch, ignoring all the enemies and items along the way for now. keep your eye on the giant envoy who will continue to shoot at you, so be ready to dodge roll before you are stuck by his barrage of bubbles. make your way to the end of this branch and you will arrive at the spot where the envoy is standing. kill it and you make your way to the altar behind it where you will find a lost ash of war . backtrack along the branch where you encountered the giant envoy and you will notice another path leading even higher. this path will lead you to a large group of envoys, including another giant one. carefully take out this small army and you can claim the oracle envoy ashes they were guarding. now backtrack along the thinner branch we used to reach the envoy earlier. this branch is covered in more plant enemies, but thankfully there is only one item to be found: a golden rune [13] near the end. next, return to the giant envoys perch and drop down onto the main branch we avoided earlier, which we are now free to loot without being harassed by projectiles. there are a large number of scarlet rot spewing plants on this branch, so you might just have to accept you are going to get rotted looting the items. the items on this path are a numens rune and flaming bolt x10. finally, make your way all the way to the bottom of this branch where you will encounter a platform with a ladder on it. climb down to reach the shack below. inside you will find the haligtree town site of grace. exit the shack through the doorway in the back to find yourself on a walkway that runs along the edge of the giant tree. you will immediately be attacked by a misbegotten. make your way past it and go down the stairs ahead to a lower platform where there are two more misbegotten praying, as well as a body with a golden rune [10] on it (at this point it is possible for the leonine above you to become aggressive and drop down on top of you, listen for any strange enemy sounds). look for the ladder on the corner of the platform and start climbing up it. as soon as you reach the top you will attacked by some rot zombies, so be careful not to get grabbed or pushed off the ledge by them. kill all of the zombies and the nearby misbegotten then you can loot the body for a rot grease x2. look behind and you will see another platform you can jump to with one of the more powerful leonine misbegottens standing on it, if it didn't become aggressive and start chasing you already. jump across the gap and kill the leonine (reminder: barricade shield completely trivializes them), then you can loot the item it was guarding, the pearldrake talisman +2. jump back over to the original platform and walk to the opposite side and look over the ledge. you will see a branch below you can drop to. follow along this branch then cross the rooftop it connects to and you will reach a platform occupied by a large number of zombies. if you have a weapon or an attack with a wide range you can easily kill them all while they are grouped up, but you can also just walk past as they are fairly slow moving. ignore the nearby staircase and make your way to the end of the zombie platform where you will find another ladder. take it down to the platform below where you can find a fire grease x5 on a nearby bridge. you will notice a number of large plant enemies below you. drop down and defeat them using a combo of fire pots and other attacks. once the plants are dead you can safely climb the nearby ladder (the one on the south side of the platform, not the north side) to get into the building above you. here you will encounter one of those axe misbegotten enemies. be careful of their incredibly delayed attacks which can be a little tricky to read, but keep in mind they can also be easily defeated with barricade shield and guard counters. once the enemies are dead you can grab the hefty beast bone x6 from the body near the ladder. go up the staircase behind where you will encounter some more misbegotten enemies and some zombies, as well as a smithing stone [8]. go back down the stairs and out the back door of the building where you can find a golden rune [13] on the balcony. go back to the ledge with the ladder and climb back down to the plant platform where will we now be climbing the other ladder on the north side. this will take you to a thin ledge where you can execute a sneak attack on a misbegotten that is waiting to ambush. kill it, then aggro the leonine and try and draw him into the nearby hut without drawing the attention of the other misbegotten on the platform. whatever happens, kill both enemies (i repeat: barricade shield, guard counters) then grab the ancient dragon smithing stone the leonine was watching over. exit this platform through the building on the other side. as you make your way through this room make sure to go out the door on the left side and grab the somber smithing stone [8] on the balcony, but be careful of the zombies lying in wait. exit out the other door and cross the bridge to reach a platform with the haligtree town plaza site of grace and a golden rune [12]. rest if you need to, but don't forget to drop down to the branch with the ants on it below this platform to get the aeonian butterfly x4. drop from the site of grace platform onto the nearby rooftops. you will immediately see a body with a smithing stone [6] on it. look down over the right side of the building and you will see one of those white snails on a ledge below. drop down and kill it to immediately dispel the crystalian that it tries to summon. peek around the corner and you will see another snail across the rooftop summoning another crystalian. rush over and kill that one quickly, hopefully before the crystalian can cast one of its powerful spells. with that snail dead immediately turn to the right where you will see another crystalian being summoned. run toward it and over the edge where you will find the final snail. look out for the attacks of the spear crystalian and kill the snail to clear the rooftops. go back to where you killed the first snail where you will see a house with some zombies in it. jump in and kill the zombies, then loot the somber smithing stone [9] in the corner. then go back out to where you killed the second snail where you will find a golden rune [10]. from here you can leap to the adjacent rooftop, which connects to a larger rooftop which is covered in zombies. these zombies will attempt to follow you as you explore the rest of the area, so i would recommend just killing them all right now to save yourself the hassle for later. once they are all cleared you can loot the smithing stone [6] in the center of the roof. climb back up onto the smaller roof we descended from and you will see a large room you can jump to with some zombies inside. the jump is a little tight so make sure you get a running start. once inside kill the couple of zombies, then you can loot the golden rune [12] and viridian amber medallion +2 from the chest in the back room. jump back across the gap and go up the ladder to get back to the large rooftop where we cleared the zombies. go to the left edge and drop down to find yourself between two buildings. enter the building you were just standing on top of and explore the two rooms inside to find some more misbegottens, as well as one item: a sacramental bud . exit this building and head into the next one over where you will encounter two more misbegottens. once they are dead look around the room. you will see a doorway leading to a bridge, but also an open window leading out to a branch. ahead are two powerful mage enemies, and you want to avoid aggro-ing both at once if possible. the optimal approach is to use the aforementioned branch to leap to the platform on the right side where the first mage is. he will hear you when you land, but if you immediately crouch he shouldn't aggro. you can walk around the platform and get behind him, then backstab for a strong start. beware the mage's powerful melee attacks in close range, especially the magic hammer attack which creates a large explosion. if you see him summon the hammer just get as far away as possible. their head slam and club swing attacks are susceptible to guard counters, but beware their endless club swing combo which will easily break your guard. remember to grab the hero's rune [4] from inside the hut before leaving this platform. once the first mage has been killed you can freely approach and kill the second as well, then loot the two items on his platform: a smithing stone [7] and smithing stone [8]. do not go ahead to the large area connecting from the center platform just yet. instead take the bridge to the third smaller platform where you will find an elevator shortcut back to the haligtree town site of grace. rest up to prepare for the upcoming boss fight, then head back down the elevator and into the large area to encounter... deja vu! loretta from the caria manor is back and stronger than ever, this time under the title loretta, knight of the haligtree . she uses a combination of powerful halberd swings and magic spells, so equip your best magic resist shield and talismans and get ready to execute some guard counters! this is a very straightforward fight. loretta will bounce between running at you and attempting various melee attacks and backing off to shoot off a few magic spells. her most common spell seems to be the homing swords. whenever she unleashes this one just stand back and wait for them to fly, then dodge roll to the side before the moment of impact. this is true for most of the spells, but one to watch for is her magic bow and arrow spell. if you rush toward her as she is charging it up then roll through you can get in 1-2 attacks as she is recovering. when it comes to melee attacks her swings are very slow and easy to dodge, but the combos are deceptive. most of them can be guard countered, but you will likely take a hit from her in return. the ones to watch out for are the sweep into powerful overhead swing (her horse will rear up onto its back legs and whinny) and the magic double slash (telegraphed by the tip of her halberd glowing blue). you can anticipate and roll through both of these, then get in multiple attacks during the cooldown period afterwards. at about half health she will enchant herself with magic, making all of her spells and attacks stronger, but it doesn't really change the fight at all other than you may take some more damage. keep an eye out for the rapid fire spells she shoots out of the handle of her halberd (roll towards her to get into melee range which causes her to stop) and be careful of the slight variation on the magic halberd slash, which has some extra swings and a new slam at the end (this seems to be avoidable by just sticking close to her). as long as you equipped a few good resist items you should be able to hold out for quite awhile, so just be patient, dodge carefully, and capitalize anytime she does one of her many slow attacks. upon defeating her you will be rewarded loretta's mastery and loretta's war sickle , and unlock access to the haligtree promenade site of grace. exit the boss arena through the doorway in the back, then take the stairs down to find a ladder. take it all the way to the bottom. at the bottom is a building with an elevator in it, but don't go inside yet. instead go around the building and up the stairs to get on top where you can get some aeonian butterfly and loot a chest that has an ancient dragon smithing stone . now go back and take the elevator inside the building down. this will bring you directly to a new area, elphael, brace of the haligtree . /n elphael, brace of the haligtree is an optional sub-dungeon located within the miquella's haligtree legacy dungeon. elphael is one of the most difficult locations in elden ring and also features the game's hardest boss. it is intended for high level, endgame players. this page will contain walkthrough and guide information on how to reach elphael, all the treasures and items that can be found inside, tips for navigating the dungeon, and how to defeat the area boss. how to get to elphael, brace of the haligtree elphael, brace of the haligtree walkthrough elphael inner wall drainage channel malenia, blade of miquella boss fight elphael is only accessible after completing the miquella's haligtree dungeon and defeating loretta, knight of the haligtree . exit her boss arena and follow the path ahead, down the ladder and elevator. this will take you straight to the edge of elphael. cross the bridge just outside the elevator (there is a cleanrot knight here, as well as a holy grease x3). enter the chapel on the other side of the bridge to reach the prayer room site of grace, and the start of the dungeon. exit the prayer room via the doorway near the site of grace and you will find yourself at the top of a high wall, with a path ahead of you leading downward. there are a few knight enemies ahead of you, not much stronger than anything we have dealt with in the past but beware the glowing footsoldiers because they can detonate themselves and deal massive damage. note the doorway on the left, go inside to find some resting soldiers and a golden rune [12]. go back outside and continue down the stairs. kill the next resting soldier, then look left again where you will see yet another open doorway. head inside and up the stairs, killing the soldiers in the way as you step out onto the balcony at the top. grab the smithing stone [8] from the edge of the balcony, then jump up onto the branch in front of you. following it up will take you to the top of a nearby tower where you can grab the miquellan knight sword . we do not want to take the ladder down at this point, so walk back up the path and back to the balcony. below the balcony is a platform with two more soldiers. drop down and kill them, then drop down again onto the staircase below. here you will see one soldier looking out over the railing and an item hanging over the railing. approach the enemy, but beware the soldier hiding in the corner, waiting to ambush. kill them both and you can claim the lightning greatbolt x5. down the stairs and straight ahead you will see a knight patrolling in front of a small building. sneak up and backstab him, but beware the second enemy lying in wait inside the building who will try and push you off the ledge. head inside the building where you will encounter two more resting enemies, as well as a smithing stone [7]. on the other side of the building is yet another resting knight, as well as a stonesword key door. use a key to dispel the barrier and you can claim the triple rings of light spell from the chest inside. retrace your steps back to the stairs and head down. here you will encounter two more knights and find a immunizing white cured meat next to an open doorway. through this door are two cleanrot knights, but before we engage with them we need to take a little detour. go back up the stairs to the balcony where we grabbed the lightning greatbolts earlier. look over the railing and you will see a buttress you can jump down into that will let you reach the platform on top of the room we were just looking into. jump over to it and you will encounter another cleanrot knight stalking the area. these guys are pretty easy to beat with a good shield and guard counters but beware their golden spear thrust which deals massive damage and inflicts scarlet rot (dodge roll forward the instant after the spear starts glowing to avoid easily). kill the cleanrot knight, as well as the nearby soldier, then you can freely loot the chest inside the room the cleanrot knight came from, which gets you the cleanrot knight finlay ashes. exit the room and look left where you will see another buttress you can reach by jumping from the roof. ascend the buttress to reach the ledge above where there is another room with a chest in it. loot the chest to receive a somber ancient dragon smithing stone . exit the room and make your way to the end of the ledge to find a body with yet another seedbed curse . drop down onto the large branch behind the body in the chair, then follow it down to find yourself on the ledge on the opposite side of the cleanrot knight room from earlier (you will also find old fang x5 here). from this side you can get the drop on the large group of guards that patrols this area. now you can enter the cleanrot knight room from the back, getting an easy backstab on both knights and drawing them out into a 1v1. once they are both dead you can grab the smithing stone [7] from inside the room, and the golden rune [10] from the attached balcony. from here the path ahead is blocked by a large number of turrets, multiple powerful knights, and an erdtree avatar. there is a site of grace just beyond so you can try to simply rush through, but there is an easier way. return to the spot near that giant branch where we found the old fangs earlier. you will notice a buttress that leads down to a platform on the other side of the gap. jump onto the buttress and cross over and you will find yourself on another rooftop, occupied by a bunch of plant enemies. ignore them entirely and proceed to the left side of this platform where you can drop down onto the staircase below. some enemies from inside the building you were just standing on will likely notice you and come out onto the stairs. kill them, then climb up the stairs where you will find yourself face to face with the soldiers manning some of the aforementioned turrets. kill them, and the soldier with the torch off to the right, then you can claim the smithing stone [8] from the ledge near the turrets and haligtree soldier ashes from the nearby altar. just past the turrets you will see another large buttress that hangs over the courtyard with the erdtree avatar below you. climb up the buttress and you will see a ledge on your right. take a running jump from the buttress to reach the ledge, then go inside the connected tower where you will find a small room with a haligtree knight helm . look over the nearby edge and you will see the elphael inner wall site of grace below. carefully drop down and activate the site, then grab the nearby smithing stone [6]. here we are faced with a very difficult encounter. outside the door, back the way we came, is the aforementioned erdtree avatar and his goons. no matter how you take him on you do not have much space to battle, plus you have to deal with two powerful haligtree knights at the same time. there is really no great way to go about this, but at least you can use an ash summon to create a distraction. if you're really struggling to win you can pull the enemies back, past the site of grace and into the thin hallway beyond where the erdtree avatar cannot fit. this way you can kill the two knights, then go back and fight the avatar one on one. killing this avatar will get you a lord's rune . one the trio are all dead you can kill the two soldiers manning the turrets in front of the avatar and finally claim the item in the bushes next to where the avatar was standing, a sacramental bud , as well as the items laid out on the bridge in front of the turrets, an arteria leaf and a golden rune [11]. with one erdtree avatar down we might as well make a detour to kill the other one in the area, which you probably noticed patrolling the tops of the castle walls. warp back to the prayer room site of grace and head out the door. kill the four soldiers in your way, then look for this buttress on the right that connects to one of the nearby towers. jump onto the buttress and cross over to the tower, then use the tower to reach the castle wall where you can see the erdtree avatar walking around. this time we have a lot more space to battle the avatar, though you still need to be careful not to let him smack you off the castle walls. follow the usual playbook here: dodge roll through his big obvious melee attacks, hit him once or twice, then back off. run away when he spreads his scarlet rot, and do a running strafe to avoid his homing magic spells. don't get greedy with your attacks and you will be able to claim victory eventually, and your reward: a rotten staff . walk along the bridge and you can also find a somber ancient dragon smithing stone , some aeonian butterfly , and a numen's rune . follow along the castle walls and you will come up to a staircase that leads you into a small building with a crystallian inside. you will need a blunt weapon to defeat the crystalian, or you can just run into her room, grab the somber smithing stone [9] inside, and run away. make your way backwards out of the building and back onto the stairs. look over the railing of the staircase and you will see a ledge you can jump to on the other side. from this ledge you can reach a connected buttress, then drop down to a platform with a doorway on it. inside is a dark room with another seedbed curse in it that overlooks another room that is full of crystallians. make sure you equip a weapon that deals blunt damage, then drop down and prepare to take on the crystallians. i highly recommend using an ash summon here, preferably the ash mimic which is guaranteed to deal blunt damage along with you. and remember, they can be backstabbed! kill all the crystallians and you can loot the items in their room: a somber smithing stone [9] and pickled turtle neck . exit the room and you will find yourself on a long street at the bottom of the castle walls. start by turning around and following the street south. here you will encounter a number of those powerful teleporting abomination enemies. you can tell where they will appear by looking for the glowing flames on the ground. your ash summon should be able to follow you through this entire area to help make things a little easier. you will encounter one near a small building with a torch out front. kill the abomination and check inside the building to find a beast blood x3. keep following the street south and you should come across two more abominations and a body with aeonian butterfly x4 before coming across a dead end with a stonesword key door. grab the golden rune [12] off the body outside the door, then use a key to open the dispel the barrier and grab marika's soreseal from the altar inside. turn around and start heading north. just past the building with the crystallians you will see a small building on your right with a lord's rune inside, then just past there is a ladder, which we are going to ignore for now (though some of the soldiers at the top of the ladder may notice the fighting and climb down). past the ladder is a left turn leading to a small courtyard with one more abomination, a smithing stone [8], and another ladder that leads back to the area where we battled the first erdtree avatar. with the smithing stone in hand we can go back to the ladder and climb up. here you will find a small room with a couple of soldiers and two cleanrot knights. if you don't want to battle them in this small space you can run and go back down the ladder to draw them to the street below (in this way you can use your ash summon again as well). once you've managed to kill all the knights you are free to grab the items in the room, a warming stone x2 and spiritflame arrow x15. with those items in hand we are finally ready to progress to the next area, so warp back to the elphael inner wall site of grace and rest up. go down the stairs near the site of grace and into the hallway below. climb on top of the giant root to your left and you will see a chest guarded by a few crystalians. because battling them is a bit annoying i would recommend just running in, grabbing the rotten crystal sword from the chest, then running back to the site of grace to reset the zone. go back into the hallway and go left this time. go past the roots and make your way to the end of the hall where you will find a hero's rune [5] behind a giant goblet. go back down the hall and climb up the giant root that is leading to the hole in the wall. this root will lead you outside to a cliffside that overlooks a rotten swamp (yes, another one). drop down to the ground below where you will immediately encounter a pest warrior. make your way down the cliff toward the swamp, but keep an eye on your left where you will see another pest warrior standing in the rot guarding an item. you will probably be inflicted with scarlet rot while walking in the swamp to kill the pest and grab the rot grease . now you can make your way down to the giant swamp below. you are forced to walk at a slowed pace while in this swamp, and there are a number of pest warriors and smaller pest enemies lurking under the surface. repeatedly rolling seems to be a little quicker than walking, but can make you susceptible to getting attacked. additionally, you will have to deal with the scarlet rot build up and damage, so you want to move as quickly as possible across the swamp. thankfully there aren't too many items in the area so you can mostly beeline for the other side. stay close to the ledge on the right side and make your way across, then drop down onto the branch on the other side. make your way to the end of this branch then use it to reach the next one underneath. make your way up the second branch and you will end up on the cliff on the other side of the swamp. if you are infected with scarlet rot you will want to immediately run into the open doorway on the wall ahead, drop down the ladder to the left, then run down there aqueduct where you will find the drainage channel site of grace. rest up and head back up to the cliffside so we can grab some more items, starting with the golden rune [11] near the top of the ladder. head out the door and immediately go up the hill on your right. kill the pest warrior here, then look to the left where you will see a large branch that extends out to another platform across the gorge. this is a large circular-ish platform with raised ledges around the edges and a swamp in the middle. there is only one item on the platform, sitting in the middle of the rot. if you attempt to approach the item the ground will start shaking and a scarlet rot infected tree spirit will slither out to battle you. thankfully the swamp on this platform does not cause as much scarlet rot as the previous one and does not cause you to force walk, so it is very possible to battle the tree spirit while standing in it. but there is also a good amount of space around the edges where you can fight as well, if you would rather avoid the rot altogether (just don't let the spirit push you off the edge). same strategies as always apply here. stay under the spirits mid-section, right around where its arms touch the ground. keep an eye out for the spirit's heavily telegraphed slam and tail whip attacks, and be sure to dodge roll away when it tries to grab you in its mouth. at around half health the spirit will start to glow and unleash an explosion, so be sure you step away before you get caught in it. defeat the spirit to get a golden seed , and grab the rare item from in the swamp, a great grave glovewort . with the tree spirit defeated we have done everything in this area. warp back to the drainage channel site of grace and get ready to move forward. exit the drainage channel via the exit near the site of grace and you will find yourself on a large branch hanging over the outer parts of the brace. walk along the branch until you reach the end of the branch, which hangs over a buttress. from this buttress you can drop to another another branch on the left which lets you get to another buttress, which lets you get to another branch, which finally lets you get on the roof of a tall chapel. you should see a couple of holes in the roof of the chapel. look down into them and you should see some ceiling beams below. carefully drop down onto one of the beams, then walk along them to the back of the chapel. you should see a ledge with a chest and a couple of pest enemies on it. drop down onto the ledge and kill the enemies, then loot the chest to get the dragoncrest greatshield talisman . from here we can drop down to the ledges on the left or right side of the chapel. we are going to drop to the right side. use the doorway on this ledge to get onto the outside balcony where you will find a nascent butterfly . go back into the chapel and drop down to the bottom floor where you will run into a few more pest warriors. from here you can get out onto the balcony on the left side of the chapel where you will find an aeonian butterfly . there is also an elevator here that will take you down to the bottom of the haligtree where you will find the haligtree roots site of grace, the boss door, and a second elevator that will take you back up to a tower near the prayer room site of grace. go down and rest if you like, but we still have some more exploring to do around this chapel. exit the chapel through the front door and you will find yourself in the middle of a long field. we will start by going to the left, down the hill covered in gravestones. as you make your way down the hill you will cross a few more of the pest enemies, so make sure you kill them as you go so you don't have to deal with too many of their projectile swarms. because there are so many its not a bad idea to do a little sneaking and get the drop on them instead of just running in. about halfway down the hill is a sort of altar where three of the pest warriors are worshipping, along with a few of the smaller pests as well. you will want to approach as stealthily as you can and start by killing the three smaller pests if possible, then turn your attention to the closest pest warrior and see if you can kill them before they have a chance to stand up. if you find yourself swarmed simply run back up the hill. they can be a little slow moving so it is possible to separate them in this way. another thing to keep in mind is that these enemies are incredibly susceptible to being toppled by a guard counter, so if you want to play it safe just stay in shield and wait for their attacks to bounce off, then counter. once you've defeated all of them you can claim the numen's rune off the stone altar they were worshipping in front of. just a little further down the hill is another small area with even more pest warriors, so use the same strategies detailed above to defeat them, then claim the ghost-glovewort picker's bell bearing [3] that they were guarding. make your way back up to the chapel so we can explore the opposite side. this side is a larger field that is populated by a number of different haligtree knights. first things first, beware the powerful knight that is hiding behind the chapel. he will try and ambush you as soon as you come around the corner, so deal with him first. next move on to the small group of knights resting at the graves near the chapel. the sounds of the battle will likely draw in the other nearby knights, so be ready to take on 2-3 more enemies. remember you can always back away to break up the pack, but keep your eyes on the enemies because a few of them have ranged magic attacks. if you don't mind being a little cheesy you can also make use of the nearby ledge to throw them off their game, as they will get stuck in an animation when they drop down from it. kill these knights and keep making your way down the hill. you will find a arteria leaf x3 on a body in the middle of a large puddle, then a hero's rune [5] at the base of a large tree near the cliff's edge. there are also two more knights here, one of which has a great bow, so be careful to avoid the mix of ranged and melee attacks they can put out. if you keep exploring further down the hill you will not find any more unique items, but there are a bunch of miquella's lily if you need them, as well as some more knights. if you don't care about any of that go back to the chapel and down the elevator to the haligtree roots. check the side room where you will see a giant flower with an item sitting in front of it. grab the item to receive the traveler's armor set . with that last item in hand the time has come... rest up at the site of grace and prepare to take on... at last we have arrived, the boss of the haligtree: malenia, blade of miquella , quite possibly fromsoft's most devious invention yet. malenia has all the typical trappings of a difficult boss (high damage, oppressive attack pattern, tricky combos), but what truly sets her apart is her unique lifesteal mechanic that gives her health back on every hit, even when you block. this means you can't just hide behind your shield and wait for an opening, or else she will steal back every bit of damage you deal. this can turn the battle into a long, drawn out war of attrition, but the better approach is to simply damage race her with the most powerful weapon you can find. ready? okay. time to fight. first thing to note is that malenia does not really zip across the battlefield very often. she doesn't have any projectile attacks so if you never get close to her she will likely just slow walk towards you until you approach. you can use this to your advantage any time you need to heal or rest for a second. when you do approach it is important to identify which of her attacks are easily punished, so here are some things to look out for: her basic sword attacks should just be avoided or blocked. she will usually execute two to three wide swings in a row, then end with a jumping slam attack or sweeping kick that deals massive stamina damage on shield. there is an opportunity to guard counter here, but i would advise against it due to the unpredictability or her combos. when you see her long blade slide backwards up her hand she is about to do a short dash followed by a multi-hit combo. i recommend just blocking the first three hits, then rolling toward her to avoid the fourth. from here she can extend the combo into a jumping slam or a delayed wide swing. both are punishable, but you need to read her movements quick to decide which one she is preparing for (jump vs. stay on ground). when you see her do a spinning jump she is about to let loose one of her kicks. do not block this attack or you may be guard broken. instead roll toward her and immediately try to punish with a few hits. move quick though! if you wait too long she will extend into a different combo finisher which can catch you off guard. if she pulls her blade back, but still has it pointed towards you she is about to do a fast, long range thrust. this is one of the easiest moves to punish, simply roll away when she dashes in, then hit her two or three times as she is regaining her posture (there is an alternate version of this where she jumps into the air before dashing, but the dodge and punish are the same). however, if she pulls her blade back with it pointed up and away from her she is about to do a short range uppercut followed by an aerial slam. this is also highly punishable, simply roll into the initial uppercut, then strafe around her to avoid the slam. hit her two or three times in the back. finally, if she gets into her stance with the blade pointed horizontally (but not pointed at you) she is about to dash in with a powerful double slash. dodge in, then strafe to avoid the second attack before punishing. if she instead pulls her empty back she is about to do one of her most deadly moves, the dash grab. roll away immediately when she starts moving to avoid getting grabbed. this attack deals massive damage, but just like the other dashes it is punishable with two or three hits. the one attack we absolutely do not want to see is her waterfowl dance. this is the move we need the barricade shield for. she signals this move by lifting into the air and curling up into a sort of fetal position for a moment, before flying toward you with a flurry of slashes. you will want to activate barricade as soon as you see her float and block the entire first volley of attacks. after this she will pause, unleash another set of attacks, then pause again, and unleash another set of attacks followed by one final area slash. to avoid the second and third flurries you need to dodge roll into her as she begins the next set of slashes. this is pretty difficult to do, but with a few attempts you can get the timing down consistently. make sure you do not run in to punish her until after the final area slash has happened. with all of the above knowledge in mind, your job is to simply win the battle of attrition. take as few hits as possible and make sure you are punishing more than she is getting back via blocked attacks. you can accelerate this process using one of the aforementioned weapons. for example, using rivers of blood you can execute 3-5 hit combos from outside of melee range, dealing massive damage and bleed. you will still need to keep an eye out for her dash attacks and flurry, but your high damage output will mean a quicker fight and less opportunities for her to heal. just make sure you have enough mind or fp flasks to keep up the assault. with enough practice and determination you will become an expert at defeating malenia. unfortunately, this is only the beginning.... yep, of course there is a second phase to this fight. as if that first phase wasn't hard enough now we have to face down a faster, more aggressive malenia with stronger attacks. oh, and of course she can inflict scarlet rot as well. she will always open the battle with the same attack, an aerial dive that leads into a giant area of effect blast that inflicts scarlet rot. you have a moment to drink one flask and put your guard up before she will dive. as soon as you see her make her move roll toward her, then run away as fast as you can to avoid the blast. you will probably get hit at least once, but that is no issue. a giant flower will bloom around her, dealing continuous rot to anyone who stands too close. this is a great opportunity to heal up or eat any damage bonus items you might have. as soon as the flower begins to fade run in and start attacking. you should be able to get three or four hits before she reacts, usually with a spinning kick. if you see the kick coming you can roll in and get in another hit or two, but she likes to follow it up with a jump into slam attack, which now leaves a delayed explosion on the ground that will prevent an easy punish. from here things get very messy. her combos have changed slightly and she is far more aggressive than she was in phase one. because of how deadly she is you aren't likely to get much time to learn the new movements before she kills you. instead i recommend a simple strategy: run away. malenia is faster than you, but if you keep running away (being sure to dodge any dashes she might do) you can eventually bait her into doing a bad attack. the main ones we want to see are her simple aerial dash attacks. she will leap high into the air, hover for a moment, then dash toward you with an easily dodged attack you can punish with two or three back attacks. however, if she points the sword toward you while in the air she is going to land and pivot before immediately executing another grounded dash attack. this is easy to dodge as long as you see it coming, and can be punished just as easily as any other dash. another easy punish is her doppelganger attack. she will float high into the air, then send down a flurry of doppelgangers who will attack one by one. the doppelgangers will attack about five times (these do not lifesteal, so you can simply block with barricade) before malenia herself flies toward you with a thrust attack. this attack can be punished similarly to the grounded dash, but you need to be careful because she will occasionally chain this directly into a second dash attack, which can also be easily dodge rolled before punishing. finally, she will occasionally do the blooming flower attack from the start of the battle. this is probably the best attack to see because it is incredibly slow and easy to punish, meaning you can take a second to heal, buff up, then hit her with everything you've got. similar to phase one, ranged weapon abilities like the ones on moonveil or sword of night and flame are invaluable here. they let you punish the attacks i've mentioned above without ever really putting yourself in real danger. all you really need is enough patience and luck to burn her down before she catches you with her enhanced waterfowl dance or grab attack. your reward for beating malenia is the remembrance of the rot goddess (which lets you craft her incredible sword), malenia's great rune , and the satisfaction that you have overcome fromsoft's most devilish challenge yet. congratulations! /n crumbling farum azula is the final legacy dungeon in elden ring, and the final new location encountered in the main storyline. this elden ring walkthrough has information on how to reach crumbling farum azula, how to navigate between the various sites of grace, how to find all the secrets and treasures, and defeat the area boss at the end. how to get to crumbling farum azula crumbling farum azula walkthrough crumbling beast grave depths tempest-facing balcony dragon temple godskin duo boss fight dragon temple altar dragon temple rooftop dragon temple lift beside the great bridge beast clergyman boss fight maliketh, the black blade boss fight how to find dragonlord placidusax dragonlord placidusax boss fight to reach crumbling farum azula you need to go to the forge of the giants site of grace (accessible after defeating the fire giant boss in mountaintops of the giants ), rest at the site of grace, then speak to melina and tell her you want to burn the erdtree (depending on what ending you are pursuing this option may be different). after the cutscene you will find yourself dropped at the end of a bridge at the edge of the farum azula dungeon. alright we've made it to the final dungeon, crumbling farum azula, let's finish elden ring! make your way toward the castle walls where you will find a smithing stone [8]. look to the right at the end of the bridge and you will see a cracked wall where you can drop off onto some platforms below. carefully drop down (grab the golden rune [9] along the way) then enter the doorway at the bottom to get inside the dungeon. once inside head down the staircase on the left to find yourself overlooking a long hallway full of beastman enemies. the one patrolling the hall is the only aggressive one, so deal with him first before picking off the others one by one. these guys are incredibly susceptible to guard counters if you have a good shield, but beware their oddly timed combos and long range because it is easy to get caught off guard by their strange attack patterns. when they are all dead you can grab the old fang x3 from the corner that one was standing over. continue down the hall and you will find yourself in a sort of cryptlike area with even more beastmen. take them out as you go along, and don't forget to grab the lightning dried liver near the cracked wall on the right side. just past this item you will see a small room on your left which contains the first site of grace, crumbling beast grave . activate this site to regain your ability to fast travel. as you leave the site of grace and head down the nearby staircase you will likely notice a stake of marika. yep, mini-boss incoming! this staircase will lead you out onto a giant ledge with a few different items scattered across it. ignore those for now and walk forward. about halfway across the screen will begin to shake and a dragon will swoop down from the sky and crash land on the ledge. two keys to this fight: focus on attacking its back legs and always stay on the upper side of the ledge near the wall to avoid being hit off. you can almost always bait the dragon into doing one of its claw swipe or slam attacks by standing in front of it, then you can rush underneath and get 4-5 free attacks on the back legs. it will do a lot of jumping around and spinning to try and catch you, so keep your shield up and keep an eye out for the fire breath attacks, especially the one it does from the sky and the one it points toward the ground, which will deal massive damage even when blocked. the dragon's lightning bolts can be easily dodged by just avoiding the glowing spots on the ground. the dragon deals big damage and has a lot of health, so just play it safe as much as possible and slowly wear it down. you will get an ancient dragon smithing stone from killing the dragon, but once it is out of the way you can claim the items on the ledge including: smithing stone [6], smithing stone [8], and dragonwound grease . make your way to the far end of the ledge and go up through the opening on the left side wall where you will find another smithing stone [8] and the crumbling beast grave depths site of grace. exit this site of grace through the nearby door and you will find yourself in a crypt guarded by two beastmen. kill them and grab the smithing stone [7] off the tomb. instead of going down the stairs by the tombs go out onto the thin outdoor balcony on the far side of the room. look to the right and you will see an accessible roof. climb up to the top of the roof where you can access the upper level of the attached building. the floor here is broken apart and the thin paths are guarded by a couple of beastmen, so be careful not to drop or be pushed through any of the holes in the ground. you can grab a gravel stone x3 from atop a tomb on the left side of the room, then make your way across to the far side of the room where you will find a smithing stone [6] hanging off the ledge near the railing. from here you can see a couple more beastmen staring at an item at the very back of the room. sneak up on them and initiate combat with a backstab on the nearest beastman. the middle beastman will start casting lightning spells that you need to dodge by looking out for the glowing pillars of red light, similar to the dragon from before. you can attempt to chase him down if you like, but he is evasive, so i found it easier to just kill the other beasts first and deal with the caster last. once they are all dead you can grab the item from the back, a great grave glovewort . make your way back to the crypt room adjacent to the site of grace and head down those stairs we ignored earlier. instead of going all the way to the bottom of the stairs go down the hallway on your left first. defeat the patrolling beastman, then turn left at the end of the hall and kill the beastman on the bridge here as well. kill the next beastman on the other side of the bridge, then follow that hallway down to the end where you will see an open door on the right that leads to a shattered balcony with a golden rune [12] on it. go back inside and down the nearby stairs where you will find a lightning greatbolt x14. finally we can go down into the center of this room where you will encounter another one of those spellcasting beastmen, along with a bunch of other beasts waiting to ambush. you can run through to the other side of the room to give yourself a little extra space to fight rather than getting surrounded. if you want a little extra insurance policy you can even run outside the door on the other side of the building and activate the site of grace outside. kill all of the beastmen chasing you down and you can go back into the room and grab the ancient dragon prayerbook from the middle of the room. take a rest at the aforementioned site of grace if you need to replenish your flasks because we are about to embark on a little mini-boss adventure. head back across the room and exit out onto the balcony on the other side. here you will see an elevator, but don't forget to grab the hero's rune [2] hiding between the pillars to the right of the stairs before heading down. go down the elevator and you will find yourself on an expansive cliffside hanging out over the endless void. immediately look over the edge to the right of the elevator where you will see a very conspicuous island in the distance. carefully cross the floating rocks and make your way to the island where you will encounter yet another dragon. this one does not have the lightning powers that the previous one did making it a little easier. employ the same strategy we used before to defeat it and claim the smithing stone [8] on the island. make your way back over to the mainland and head down the path where you will encounter some of those strange worm spewing enemies you may have seen in altus plateau. their expulsions can afflict death blight, which triggers instant death if it builds to max. keep your rejuvenating boluses close and don't be afraid to run away if you build up too much blight too quickly. when the path splits take the high road on the left first which will lead you to a tree with an item and an enemy behind it. kill the enemy and grab the fulgurbloom x4 before proceeding. continue along this path and you should see two brick towers on your right. drop down to the base of the towers and kill the enemies standing around. there is a somber smithing stone [9] at the base of a tree behind the nearer of the two towers. with that item in hand you can climb the ladder on the tower to reach the top where you will find another enemy and a smithing stone [8]. to the left of the enemy you will see an opening in the railing. look over the edge and you will see some rocks you can jump to below. jump all the way down the rocks to reach ground level again. you will be near a thin creek that runs into a large puddle of water where a few more enemies are resting, including one massive enemy. you don't actually get anything for killing these enemies, so i recommend just crouching and sneaking around them to grab the items in the water, rejuvenating boluses and a smithing stone [8]. finally make your way to the gazebo on the other side of the puddle where you will find glovewort picker's bell bearing [3]. there is one last little section of cliff if you follow the path down from the puddle. make your way all the way to the end of the path and you will find one last enemy waiting for you, guarding the final item: gravel stone x5. that concludes our search of this area, so warp back to the tempest-facing balcony site of grace. immediately drop off the balcony and onto the rocky cliff behind it where you will see the somberstone miner's bell bearing [4] sitting on the edge of the cliff. go left where you will see a bunch of floating debris below you. carefully make your way down the rocks and onto the large platform at the bottom. here you will encounter a large number of undead foes, wielding both melee and ranged weapons. they are all relatively weak, but you do have to make sure you hit them one last time after they die to ensure they stay dead. once all the enemies are dead go up to the top of the platform where you will find a golden rune [9] behind one of the pillars, then make your way to the bottom of the platform where you will see an item sitting on an isolated platform you can jump to. loot it to get a somber smithing stone [7]. go to the far side of the platform and you will see a downed pillar forming a sort of bridge to another piece of floating debris with an item on it. run down to the platform and grab the golden arrow x14, then keep moving to avoid the fire breath from the dragon watching over this area in the distance. quickly drop down to the platform below and get behind the pillars at the top where you can avoid the flames. here you will encounter a new type of larger undead enemy. these ones actually have a bit of health and can deal some serious damage, but they are slow moving and highly susceptible to guard counters and backstabs. as always, make sure to add that final hit to keep them down. grab the gravel stone x3 nearby, then look directly right from the gravel stone where you will see a pillar with a corpse strapped to it. check behind that pillar to find a somber smithing stone [9]. there is a little more exploring to be done here, but first look east where you will see a large building with a site of grace out in front of it. jumping between the floating rocks to make your way over to the dragon temple site of grace and activate it. turn around and look down and you should see a set of stairs below you. make a running jump from the site of grace platform to land on them. go up the stairs and into the open door on your right where you will be immediately ambushed by a large undead. kill it to claim the golden rune [12] nearby. go back through the door and continue up the path where you will be ambushed by yet another undead. ignore the door he popped out of for now and instead follow the forward path all the way to the end where you will find a golden rune [10]. go back to the doorway the last undead jumped out of and follow it through to the other side. kill the archer standing by the railing, then go left across the downed pillar to reach a balcony with a ladder on it. climb up to find that archer who has been taking shots at you all through this area. kill it, then look to the left where you will see an ominous looking hallway with an item at the end. run up and claim the item, a great grave glovewort , then get ready to face the three undead that drop from the ceiling behind you. once you've killed them all that's it for this area, so you can teleport back to the dragon temple site of grace from earlier. rather than going right in the front door we are going to start exploring from the bottom. jump back to the stairs below the site of grace, then jump from the stairs to the landing underneath the building. immediately go to the left side where you will see a banished knight with a halberd standing near an item. these guys are strong, but pretty oblivious, so you can almost always sneak up on them and get a backstab to initiate. as always strafing and guard countering works well, but beware their more powerful weapon arts which are telegraphed by a gust of wind rushing around them as they attack. these are more difficult to interrupt and deal a lot of damage. just block or roll through if you see one coming. kill this guard and you can claim the rune arc on the ledge near him. go around the corner and into the building through the large doorway. head down the hall where you will encounter another banished knight with his back turned. try to draw him backward rather than into the room ahead to avoid alerting any other enemies. this next room contains two more banished knights who would love nothing more than to take you on in a 2v1, but if we move carefully we can avoid that altogether. walk into the room and crouch behind the nearest tomb. you will see the dual-blade knight ahead of you, but after or 10 seconds the halberd knight will walk out of the doorway on the right side of the room. wait for him to walk past then sneak your way toward the door he came from and out onto the ledge outside. walk to the corner of the balcony and grab the somber smithing stone [9], then head back to the doorway and try and get the attention of the halberd knight who is patrolling inside the room. you should be able to get him to notice you at which point he will run outside to fight you without the dual-blade knight noticing. take out the halberd knight in the one on one, then sneak up on the other knight to clear out the room. once he is dead you can grab the azula beastman ashes off of the tomb he was guarding. next go to the other side of the room where you can jump down to a hallway below. run to the end of the hall and up the stairs where you will find the dragon temple transept site of grace. activate this site, but don't go up the nearby stairs unless you want to wander into the mid-boss fight. instead warp back to the dragon temple site of grace so we can continue our exploration of the area. from the site of grace this time we will go straight ahead through the door, then to the left over the smashed pillar and onto the ledge beyond where you can find a golden rune [11]. go back into the hallway and make your way down to the other end where you will encounter another halberd knight and find a smithing stone [6] at the ledge. head down the nearby staircase which will lead you to a balcony with yet another banished knight waiting nearby. to the left is a dead end and jumping off the balcony ahead will get you into the aforementioned boss room, so instead we are going to go right and down the hallway rather than the stairs. kill the knight patrolling the hallway, then round the corner at the end where you will see another knight standing at a ledge. kill him to claim the item next to him, a stonesword key . go up the stairs and back into the building where you will find another hall and another knight. make your way down to the end of this hall to find a dragonwound grease x2 at the end. from here you can jump down onto the crumbling staircase below, which has a golden rune [12] at the top. kill the banished knight at the bottom of the stairs to wrap up our exploration of the dragon temple. if you are feeling confident you can head inside the nearby room which leads to the boss fight i mentioned earlier, but i would recommend just teleporting to the dragon temple transept site of grace to rest up before heading into... godskin noble . godskin apostle . as if these guys weren't annoying enough on their own, now you get to battle them at the same time! just because these are familiar foes does not make things much easier, but the silver lining is that these are weakened versions of the bosses. you should already be at least somewhat familiar with these enemies from your past encounters, so my main advice for this new encounter is simple: cheese them (a little). there are a number of large pillars scattered around the boss arena which you can use to put distance between you and the bosses. they will crumble when attacked, and certain moves and projectiles will reach over them, but the bosses can not simply walk over them like you can giving you a massive advantage when you use them correctly. the most annoying aspect of this fight is that the two bosses will often stick close together and constantly throw projectiles at you when at a distance, but by positioning yourself around the pillar you can force them to split up and even block some of their black fireballs. this strategy allows you to create more openings to punish one boss or the other. additionally, if you have a projectile, spell, or a weapon with a medium to long range weapon art (like moonveil or sword of night and flame ) you can hit them through the pillar like they will try to do to you. like i said before, these are weakened versions of the godskin bosses, mostly when it comes to their health pools. you will notice they die very quickly, but the boss health bar is quite massive. similar to the four kings from dark souls more godskin bosses will keep spawning until you have depleted the entire bar. the good news is once one boss dies it takes some time for another to spawn. this is your chance to really lay into the other godskin boss, and this is where you need to dictate the pace of the fight most of all. your goal should be to use whatever resources necessary to burst down one of the godskin bosses, whichever once you feel less confident against in the one on one. for example, i split the two enemies up and then unleashed a rivers of blood full weapon art combo (as always, bleed is highly effective) to kill one of the bosses near the start. turn your focus to the other boss, doing as much damage as you can while you wait for them to summon. when you see them calmly and slowly raise their hand into the air they are preparing to summon their ally back, and this is your opening to unleash whatever big combo you have to burn down the second foe. in this way you should almost always be able to keep yourself in a one on one, or at least have one of the bosses incredibly weakened at all times. in my fight i had to kill four godskin bosses in total to fully deplete the health bar. the reward for defeating this army of godskin warriors is the smithing stone miner's bell bearing [4] and the ash of war: black flame tornado . rest at the newly spawned dragon temple altar site of grace and prepare to explore the rest of the dungeon. exit the boss room through the doorway to the left of the site of grace and you will find yourself on another ruined outside balcony. on the ledge below you are two beastmen, one with a sword and another with throwing daggers. you can get a drop attack on them, or try and sneak using the stairs to the right. handle them however you like, then take the staircase near the torch in the corner to proceed. this will lead you to another ledge where a dog is guarding an item. kill the dogs and grab the golden rune [11] before dropping through the windows on the left. here you will encounter two more dogs and another one of those dagger throwing beastmen. you will have to walk around the perimeter of the room to reach the beastman, or if you are feeling daring you can try to jump over the gap on the left edge of the room to get right to him. you can grab the old fang x5 off the body near the beastman, then kill the two dogs waiting on the other side of the room. before you jump off this platform make sure you carefully walk around the outside edge of the outer wall. there is a thin hidden platform you can jump to with another item on it, a hero's rune [5]. now you can drop down to the next platform, a long hallway lined with dragon statues. near the end of the hall you will encounter another beastman with a large sword. defeat him, then keep going forward to the very end of the hall where you can find a smithing stone [7] behind a fallen pillar. from here look to the left and around the corner where you will see another section of ledge on the other side of the wall. follow this around and you will find a dead end with two more beastmen waiting to ambush you, and a lightning grease x5. go back to the hallway where you fought the beastman with the large sword and you should see a staircase that spirals upwards. take it up to the second level where you will immediately encounter yet another beastman. behind him you should see a pillar hanging down from a higher platform in the distance. take a running leap over to that pillar and use it to reach the platform above. here you will encounter a stronger variety of beastman. the beastman is crouched when you first approach so use that moment to get the opening attack, but beware his dog companion waiting to ambush you nearby. make good use of your shield here to ward off their attacks and wear them both down with guard counters. once they are defeated you can claim the item they were guarding, an ancient dragon smithing stone . go down the pillar and jump back to the platform we started on. go forward all the way to the other end of the hall where you will encounter another dagger throwing beastman on a ledge who we want to kill so he doesn't bother us later. make your way back down the hall and go through the large opening across from the stairs to reach a new room with two more beastmen lying in wait. one is a dagger thrower who should be patrolling left to right, and the other is a swordsman waiting behind some debris in the corner. kill them both, and don't forget to grab the somber smithing stone [9] from behind one of the pillars near the beastman's hiding spot. in the corner of this room you will see a stonesword key door. use one of your keys to dispel the magic barrier, then head inside where you will find an elevator. take it up to reach a new site of grace, the dragon temple lift . we will come back to this area later, so for now just activate the site and go back down the elevator. make you way back to that staircase and head back down to the first floor hall. go through the doorway to the left of the stairs and you will find yourself on a sort of bridge made of floating debris. carefully make your way down the bridge, making sure to grab the two items along the way ( golden rune [12] on one side, dragoncrest shield talisman +2 on the other). at the bottom is another door to a building that is very similar to the one we just left. head inside and immediately go left and kill the two beastmen waiting in the hall. turn around and go all the way to the opposite end where you will find a staircase that leads up to the second floor, guarded by some more enemies. make your way up to the top and go right where you will see a dog guarding a corpse with an item, a dappled cured meat . with that item in hand we can head back down to the first floor hall and through the large doorway across from the entryway. this leads to a large balcony where you will see the corpse of a dragon, and encounter another a crucible knight . as always, the best approach to defeating these guys is to parry, but take whatever approach you feel is best. be careful of the dragon incantations in the second phase, especially the wide fire breath he does after taking in a big breath. there is no reward for defeating this knight, but you can jump to the floating piece of debris behind the dragon and grab the smithing stone [8] from atop it. from here you can leap to the rooftop below, then ascend it to find a new site of grace, the dragon temple rooftop . drop down from the rooftop and make your way to the base of the tall tower nearby where you will encounter two stormhawks waiting to ambush you. these hawks are considerably stronger than the ones we faced in the past, so be careful not to let them gang up on you too much or you may just get caught in a deadly stunlock. grab the smithing stone [6] they were huddled around and look to the south where you will see a large dragon in the distance. this dragon will cast lightning spells on you as you make your way through the area ahead, so you will have to dodge the lightning strikes as you make your way forward. rather than go down the nearby ladder, start by jumping to the rooftop to your right where you will encounter another stormhawk. kill this hawk, then drop down to the ground below where you will find arteria leaf x3 under the balcony, and encounter two more stormhawks you will have to battle while dodging bolts. keep moving forward until you reach yet another rooftop, at which point you will go right and drop to the cracked bridge below. make your way to the bottom of the bridge, killing the two stormhawks along the way, and you will finally reach the platform where the dragon is waiting. the good news is this dragon's health is at about 15% of max, so it should only take one or two combos to take it down for good and claim another ancient dragon smithing stone . with the dragon dead we can claim the two items it was standing on, a golden rune [12] and fulgurbloom x8. look to the southeast where you will see a gazebo with another item in it, a somber ancient dragon smithing stone . from here look north where you will see a raised platform with some pillars on it. make your way over to the cliff's edge where you will find a roof you can use to get on top of the platform, where you will encounter a large group of stormhawks, a smithing stone [7], and a golden seed . backtrack like you are headed back to the gazebo and you will see a group of descending rocks floating below the cliff's edge. you can use these to reach a set of buildings floating far below you. once you drop onto the building's platform head inside where you will immediately encounter a banished knight. defeat him and head to the end of the hallway where you can exit onto a small balcony with a stormhawk and another banished knight. try to draw out the knight without the hawk if you can for an easier battle, but once both are dead you can grab the item the hawk was guarding, a golden rune [12]. head up the nearby ladder to reach the upper level of this building. you will see an elevator ahead, and to the left of that is a banished knight patrolling the area. kill the knight and you should notice a treasure chest near the railing to the left of the ladder. inside is the dragon towershield . take the nearby elevator up and you will end up on another rocky path that leads into a crumbling hallway that exists underneath the dragon's platform. follow this path to the top and you will find a crucible knight duking it out with a couple of beastmen. if you stand back the knight will easily kill all of the enemies, but you can also use this opportunity to get the drop on him while he is preoccupied. if you have a particularly powerful weapon art of spell this is the moment to use it and deal as much damage to the knight as you can before he turns his attention to you. once the knight is dead you can grab the nearby item, then go up the ladder at the end of the hall where you will find an open window an another item, the boltdrake talisman +2. jump out the window onto the platform below and head left like you are going back to the site of grace, but instead of going up the ladder at the end look off the ledge to the right where you should see a small rock platform below. drop to that platform, then onto the ledge below to reach the bottom of a tall tower. run all the way around the tower where you will find a chest at the dead end containing the drake knight armor set . go back around tower get inside using the large door, then take the elevator up to the top. here you will find a short bridge with another powerful beastman enemy at the end, as well as a lightning greatbolt x5. take the elevator back down, jumping off at the midpoint, then run all the way back to the area where we battled the dragon. this time we are going to follow the path to the right, where you will run into a couple more beastmen sleeping under a tree. defeat them, as well as the other beastman who is patrolling the path, and keep making your way forward. a beastman will attempt to ambush you from the opening on the right. drop down onto the nearby cliff where you will find a somber smithing stone [7]. at the end of this path is a large gap with a piece of tower serving as a bridge to the other side. run as fast as you can, straight across the right pillar, to reach the other side before the dagger throwing beastman on the other end can get into position to stop you. once you cross the gap kill the beastman and enter the nearby building. inside is a spellcaster beastman watching over an item. of course this room is an ambush, so try and draw out the sword beastman and try to get him to follow you outside where you will have more space to fight him and dodge the lightning bolts. once the melee enemy is dead you can head back inside and kill the other beasts, then grab the item near the altar, the somberstone miner's bell bearing [5]. go through the doorways on the right and follow the path all the way around to reach yet another new elevator. take the elevator up to reach a new site of grace, beside the great bridge . because this is the final grace of the area we are going to take a quick detour to explore one last area before finishing this dungeon out. activate this site of grace then warp back to the dragon temple lift site of grace. if you remember, this is the area that was locked behind the stonesword key door earlier in the dungeon. exit the site of grace via the stairs that lead outside, then go left toward the sort of plaza in the distance. here you will encounter some more of those undead enemies. there are two weaker ones watching over an item in the center of the plaza, but two of the larger undead enemies will join the fight as soon as you approach. if the idea of fighting four enemies at once is not attractive, you can draw out the weaker enemies with a projectile to avoid alerting the larger ones until after they area dead. once all four enemies are defeated you can claim the item in the center of the plaza, a lord's rune . from the plaza there is a split road, one leading down the hill and another leading up. we are going to start by taking the downward path, where you will run into another undead enemy standing near a tree, as well as a guard dog. defeat them and you can grab the item under the tree, a nascent butterfly x2. keep following this path and go around the corner where you will find some scalable rocks. climb up to the top, then go immediately right to the ledge where you will find another item, a smithing stone [7]. there is a large group of undead patrolling the nearby path, but thankfully this area does allow for ash summons, so i highly recommend you just simplify the whole mess by calling yourself an ally. try and draw them out and split them up if you can, and as always don't forget to lay on that final hit. once the enemies are dead you can take the staircase to your left up onto the raised platform. immediately turn around and walk over to the cliff's edge where you will see an undead staring out into the void, and find a smithing stone [8]. turn around and head back the other direction where you will find another golden seed , as well as a rune arc . keep moving forward and you will come up to a ledge. look down and you should see an ash scarab behind some pillars. kill this scarab to receive the golden lightning fortification spell. look to your left and you will see another dragon sleeping on the cliff's edge. we will kill that in a second, but first go right to the cliff's edge on the side opposite the dragon where you will find a short path that leads down to a dragonwound grease x2. walk back up the path and make your way over to the snoozing dragon and get ready for a fight. this is a full strength dragon, but thankfully one without any lightning powers. using the same strategy detailed earlier in this guide, defeat this dragon and claim the item underneath it, a smithing stone [8]. climb back up onto the cliff above you and you will notice that there are some pillars you can climb across to reach the higher cliff on the other side. from here you can scale the fallen building to reach an even higher platform, where you will encounter another sleeping dragon. as always be very careful not to let this dragon sweep you off the platform (this one is fairly thin). kill this one in the same way you did the previous one then grab the item it was guarding, a golden rune [12]. on the other side of this platform you will see a bunch of floating debris you can climb onto, so make your way up onto and across the ruins. you will find a smithing stone [7] near the far end, and in the back corner is another long pillar you can walk up to reach a higher platform. from here you will need to look down and drop onto another pillar below you to proceed. this pillar will bring you to the final platform in this section, which has a shattered tower sitting on it. check inside the tower to find the ancient dragon apostle's cookbook [4], but beware the two undead enemies waiting to ambush you when you step inside. with the cookbook in hand there are just two more items to grab. if you look over the cliff to the side of this broken tower you should see a fairly large section of floating rock below, with an item on it. jump down to claim this loot, a somber smithing stone [8]. look down again and you should see a smaller section of floating rock with yet another item on it. drop down to that one to get a smithing stone [8]. we are now ready to warp back to the beside the great bridge site of grace and explore the final area of this dungeon. head up the stairs in front of the site of grace and go right to get up onto the great bridge, to the right is the boss arena, guarded by a powerful mini-boss, so for now we are going to go left instead. follow it all the way down to reach yet another crumbling building. go through the door and down the stairs, ignoring the sleeping beastmen along the way. go out the door on the other side and take a left where you will see a whole balcony of beastmen laying around. ignore them and grab the somber smithing stone [8] from the body near the ledge. turn around and go to the other side of the balcony where you will see a ladder leading down to a bridge. make your way toward the end of the bridge but do not go inside the tower. wait a moment and you will be invaded by recusant bernahl . he is a moderately powerful enemy wielding a big mace, but he has no defensive options so you can really just wail on him, or put up a barricade shield and relentlessly guard counter gim to death. killing him will get you a bunch of items: blasphemous claw , devourer's scepter , the gelmir's fury spell, and the beast champion armor set . now you can head inside the tower where you will immediately be attacked by three beastmen lying in wait. try and draw them out onto the bridge to give yourself a little extra space, but really you're just gonna have to play carefully and defensively to beat them down without getting overwhelmed. your reward for defeating them is the chest inside the tower, which contains the old lord's talisman . with all of these items in hand we are finally ready to take on the mini-boss. warp back to the beside the great bridge site of grace, walk up to the bridge, and go right where you will encounter a familiar face: the draconic tree sentinel . sadly we cannot face off against him on horseback this time, so we are going to have to change up our strategy a little from our last encounter. first thing to keep in mind is that the sentinel will almost always shoot fireballs at you if you are out of melee range, which can be useful for timing a heal or getting a second to rest, but is annoying if you are trying to play a ranged focus strategy. for this reason you will want to stay fairly close to him most of the time, as his melee attacks are almost all very easy to dodge or block, especially his shield swings. for this reason it is recommended you try to stay on his shield side, and simply dodge roll through or guard counter his slow swipes and slams. anytime the horse rears up on its hind legs the sentinel is prepping for one of its big attacks, so its usually best to just back of a bit and wait it out unless you are very confident with your dodge timing. stay close, keep your shield up, and keep the attacks flowing and you should get the first phase of the fight over pretty quickly. second phase is where things get a little crazier. the sentinel will power himself up with lightning power and start using a wider variety of spells, along with stronger versions of his normal attacks. his melee swings are still highly telegraphed and predictable, but blocking them instead of dodging will now result in a little damage. the dream attack in this phase is his area of effect lightning bolts. for this move he will point his shield to the sky, then swing it to the side, causing a bunch of lightning bolts to start forming around him. quickly move to a spot where there is no lightning forming and you can get in 3-4 attacks during the spell's duration. however, if he points his shield to the sky and holds it there for a second before pumping his arm he is summoning a focused bolt of lightning that will fall right on you. you can block this and simply eat the damage, or try and dodge right as the lightning strikes to avoid it entirely. with all of that in mind this becomes a long battle of careful dodges and small punishes. if you need to heal simply back up and wait out a fireball, being sure to drink quickly between the casts. defeat the sentinel to receive his malformed dragon armor set , plus you can grab the items along the bridge: a golden rune [12] and somber smithing stone [7]. from here there are actually two bosses we can take on, in any order. one is the area boss, and the other is an entirely optional boss that does drop a remembrance. this guide will start with the area boss, but skip ahead to the final section if you would rather do the optional boss first. another familiar face, the beast clergyman is the final boss of farum azula. but is this the same clergyman we met at the bestial sanctum? only one way to find out... most of his moveset consists of dashing around and throwing rocks at you, especially when you are out of his melee range. these attacks are incredibly easy to see coming (he drags his hand along the ground before throwing) and you can just dodge roll toward him to avoid the damage. this creates a good opportunity to heal as well, so just back off and bait out one of his rock throws anytime you need a sip from your flask (just like the godskin duo , you can use the pillars here as a shield as well). when you are in melee range he will do a lot of different swings and jabs with his dagger. keep an eye out for his long range forward stab, which is telegraphed by him doing a small hop then fully thrusting his dagger forward. you can dodge roll into this then get a few attacks off before he regains his composure. for the most part though our strategy will be to stand in front of him with our shield up, waiting for his long dagger combo that ends with a downward dagger thrust. he usually opens with two quick dagger slashes, then adds a third before standing up and raising his dagger into the air. this is the attack we want. if you have barricade shield activate it here, wait for the attack, then guard counter it. if you do not, you can simply dodge roll in before the dagger impact and get a few attacks in. keep a close eye on his hands though. if he thrusts his offhand into the ground instead of his dagger he is actually about to unleash an area of effect spell, so do not attempt to punish or guard counter him. instead just keep your guard up or roll through it. similarly, if he thrusts his hands into the ground and the area around him starts glowing he is about to summon a blast of rocks from the ground, which will deal damage as they burst forth, and deal damage again when they fall back to the ground. you can get one or two attacks in before the rocks emerge, but the safest bet is just to back away with your guard up. dodge the rock blasts and guard counter his slow dagger slam and you will burn down half his health bar in no time, which means it's time for... you didn't think it would be that easy did you? now the beast clergyman reveals his final form as maliketh, the black blade . he becomes much more powerful, with a whole new set of moves and two annoying debuffs, one that reduces your max health and another that damages you slowly over time, which are triggered whenever you are struck by his burning blade. just like the clergyman, maliketh loves to dash all around the battlefield, attacking from every angle possible, plus he has added a number of jumping attacks to his arsenal as well. much like the clergyman, we are just going to keep our shield up and avoid as much of this as possible, waiting out a few specific attacks that are most punishable. the main attacks we are looking for are his horizontal grounded slash and slow overhead slash, both of which offer a great opportunity to attack. you can usually bait these out by just standing around in front of maliketh, but there are a few combo paths he can follow. after the horizonal slash along the ground, he may grab his sword with both hands and swing it over his head, slamming the ground. this is the best case scenario. you can strafe to the side of him and attack 3-4 times before he regains posture. he may also chain that slash into a jumping triple slash, which you can strafe to the side of then punish when he lands. if he instead opens the combo with the overhead slash, do not attempt to punish immediately as he can chain that into a quick horizontal slash, or a spinning triple slash. these are punishable as well if you keep your guard up, but it may be easier just to back off and wait for a better opening. next, some attacks we want to avoid. anytime maliketh jumps into the air and thrusts his sword into the ground, simply get away or attack with a projectile. this looks like a great opportunity to attack, but the thrust triggers a powerful explosion about a second later you do not want to be caught in (after the explosion maliketh does a backflip before landing back on the ground. if you are in position behind him you can get one or two attacks in as he lands). additionally, he will occasionally chain one thrust into a vertical jump slash that ends with a giant flurry of slashes which will kill most players instantly if not blocked. my advice is to just get away. same goes for just about all of his jump attacks really. most of them have large areas of effect and erratic movements, so its better just to strafe away and not even try to get involved or else you may just get caught in his blender of attacks. this goes double for his sword projectiles, which he will launch out from his sword while spinning in the air. he will usually telegraph these attacks by jump up onto one of the pillars first, before launching himself into the air. his most powerful variant of this attack sees him fire off three sword projectiles with a small delay in between each one before dashing back into the ground with a massive circular swing. if you see this one coming you want to dodge roll toward him, through each of the projectiles, then dodge roll inward one last time as he comes flying back to earth to avoid the final slash. this attack is very deadly, but the dodge timing is fairly forgiving. just like before, you can use the pillars around the battlefield to create a barrier between you and maliketh and block his attacks and projectiles, but know that some of his attacks, including the aforementioned circular slash, will hit through the pillar. wait out his less dangerous attacks and slowly wear him down (or perfect the blasphemous claw parry if you are feeling confident) and you will eventually topple this formidable enemy and obtain his reward, the remembrance of the black blade . after a short cutscene you will be warped to a new, yet familiar, area to find dragonlord placidusax, warp to the beside the great bridge site of grace, then go backwards through the temple where you previously battled that group of beastmen. exit the temple through the front entrance and run directly forward to the edge of the floating platform. look down and you will see some rocky platforms you can drop to. follow these rocks all the way to the bottom and jump onto the floating ruins at the very end, near the base of the tempest. inspect the ground and you will notice one of the "graves" is empty. walk up to the empty grave and you will be prompted to "lie down". hit this prompt to activate a cutscene that takes you to the dragonlord's boss arena. oh miyazaki, you just couldn't stop yourself from adding just one last giant dragon boss, huh? dragonlord placidusax is a fairly typical dragon boss, and bears a few similarities to the large dragons we were battling all around farum azula. he always starts the fight with one of his roars, which summons a series of lightning strikes on top of you. simply run out of the area of effect to dodge it, or learn the roll timing and dodge just before the strike hits. like many dragons, the ideal place to stand for this fight is to the side or behind the dragons legs. he has a fairly long tail that you can hit to deal good damage while staying out of range of all his forward face fire and claw attacks. while standing behind there are three attacks you need to watch out for: the lightning roar: same as the one he opened the fight with. each roar triggers three lightning strikes, with a short delay between each. you can attack during this sequence, but you need to move out of the strike or dodge roll between attacks to avoid it. firebreath: even when you are attacknig the tail, make sure you are watching the heads! the dragonlord will occasionally turn one of his heads around and breathe a stream of fire at you. move out of the way or just put your shield up and tank the damage. tail swipe: the dragonlord will lift his tail up into the air, then swing it along the ground. this is incredibly easy to dodge or block as long as you see it coming, but it also causes the dragonlord to spin around so you have to reposition yourself afterwards. dashing firebreath: the dragonlord dashes away, turns around, then lets loose a stream of flames directly at you. you can simply step back to avoid this, or do a wide strafe to get out of range. when facing you the dragonlord will do a few different attacks: a horizontal claw swipe that can be easily dodged by rolling into it, a vertical claw smash that causes an explosion on the ground (back away or block), or a long duration firebreath that covers the area in front of him. i would not recommend trying to punish any of these attacks because they are a bit erratic and he sometimes chains them into each other. just do your best to get behind him again and hack away at his tail or hind legs. he also has a rare but powerful lightning spear attack. he will jab the spear into the ground, wait a moment, then slam it with his claw, creating a massive expolsion that covers the battlefield. i only saw this attack once, but i recommend just getting as far away as you can and putting your shield up. at 50% health the dragonlord will float into the air and disappear, triggering phase two of the fight. start scanning the sky, looking out for an accumulation of clouds and electricity. after a short duration the dragonlord will burst out of this cloud and do a swooping attack across the ground, which you can dodge by rolling into it right as he passes over you. from here he will continue to disappear, reappear, do one attack (usually a slow claw swipe), then disappear again. you can usually land one or two hits after his attack and before he disappears again. if you stay locked on your cursor will generally instantly snap to wherever the dragon teleported to, so use this to keep track of him. the sequence will end after about three attacks, and the dragonlord will return to his normal moveset for a bit before eventually disappearing again and doing the whole thing over again. when the dragonlord reaches about 25% health he will start an ongoing lightning storm all around the arena, so you need to be even more vigilant in dodging the lightning strikes. he will also mix in an extra powerful variant of his firebreath, where the flames turn into solid beams that sweep across the battlefield. you can roll through these beams as they pass through you, or you can simply put your shield up and get far back where most of them won't reach. once the beams reside rush back in and keep up the assault. keep playing it safe and striking his tail until he falls. once the dragon dies you will be rewarded with the remembrance of the dragonlord . /n leyndell, ashen capital is an alternate state of leyndell, royal capital that appears after defeating maliketh, the black blade . it is technically the final area of elden ring and the home of the game's final boss. this page will contain guide information on how to reach leyndell, ashen capital , how to navigate between the various sites of grace, how to find all the secrets and treasures, and defeat all of the powerful bosses. how to get to leyndell, ashen capital leyndell, ashen capital walkthrough sir gideon ofnir, the all-knowing boss fight godfrey, first elden lord boss fight boss fight hoarah loux, warrior boss fight radagon of the golden order boss fight elden beast boss fight as stated in the introduction to this guide page, leyndell, ashen capital is only accessible once the player has completed crumbling farum azula and defeated maliketh the black blade . immediately after maliketh is killed a cutscene will trigger, which ends with you waking up in the transformed capital. activate the leyndell, capital of ash site of grace nearby then head directly south where you will find a body with a rune arc on it on a sloping hill. from this body head right down the hill until you reach the bottom where you will see an open building and an open sewer. you can drop into the sewer to find the crimson amber medallion +2, but you will have to warp back to the site of grace to get out of the sewer. inside the building you will find a tarnished golden sunflower . head out the other side of the building and walk straight forward where you will come across the giant dragon corpse, this time mostly buried under sand. however, you can still climb up its arm to get into the ramparts. look down off the right side, where the roundtable hold building is, and you will see an item by the front door and a gargoyle patrolling the street. jump down to the street and grab the item, a somber ancient dragon smithing stone , then simply run away from the gargoyle. warp back to the site of grace and go south once again. this time run past the rune arc body and you will see a staircase in the distance behind. before going up the staircase check the rooftops on the left where you can find a hero's rune [4]. turn around and go up the staircase, then take the elevator up. follow the path forward to the erdtree sanctuary where we previously encountered godfrey, but this time the occupant is... oh sir gideon , not you too. ah well, looks like we will have to kill our old pal to progress. thankfully he is a bit of a glass cannon who can be burst down with just a few good combos. sir gideon makes good on his "all-knowing" title with his moveset, which is a combination of abilities stolen from all of the game's major bosses. various spells from renalla, blood magic from mohg, scarlet aeonia from malenia, rykard's rancor, and so on. most of these spells deal massive damage, so be on your guard especially when it comes to renalla's soul spears. because most of these attacks are projectiles you can stand behind the pillars near the middle of the room as a barrier to block them. the one spell you do need to look out for is law of causality, the glowing ring buff he occasionally places on himself. if you hit him too many times while he has this buff active it will explode and deal massive damage. the good news is gideon has all the same weaknesses as any humanoid enemy. he can be strafed and backstab fairly easily. he can be easily stunlocked with a fast weapon. i was able to kill him in a flash using the rivers of blood weapon art which he wasn't quick enough to get out of. he died so fast i almost expected there to be a phase two, but alas there is not. the reward for defeating gideon is the scepter of the all-knowing and the all-knowing armor set . the erdtree sanctuary site of grace will appear again, allowing you to rest and level up if needed. from here you can take the large root up to the second floor just like you did after defeating godfrey. follow the path to the queen's bedchamber site of grace, where you will find a new spell, erdtree heal . after resting up at the site of grace you can head up the staircase to the boss arena where we previously fought morgott, the omen king . oh hey speaking of godfrey... this is more or less the same godfrey, first elden lord boss battle we experienced our first time through leyndell, and just like that version of godfrey this one is highly susceptible to guard counter abuse. as you enter the battle, he almost always opens with just jumping axe throw. simply roll backwards to avoid the axe impact, then you can sneak in 2-3 attack on godfrey when he lands and picks it back up. from here you just want to stay near godfrey with your shield up at pretty much all times. we want to wait out one of his many slow swinging attacks so we can guard counter him into a topple. in general there rule is that is he slams his axe into the ground rather than sweeping it across the ground, the combo is over. he also like to telegraph when his big combo enders are coming by delaying his swing extra long or spinning the axe over his head. these are the moments where you can toss in a guard counter, but if your defense and poise are high enough you can sometimes hit multiple guard counters across one of his combos and just power through the damage. after a topple you have just enough time to drink a flask before executing the critical attack, so make sure to heal up! there are exceptions to the aforementioned rule though. if he opens his combo with the downward axe slam, he is about to follow it with an uppercut. after his stomp he frequently combos into a grounded axe slam which leads into a massive area of effect slam when he steps on the axe and digs it into the ground. the wind up and cooldown of this attack are fairly slow, so try and sneak in an attack or two between your guards. speaking of the stomp, this is one of his most favored attacks, and it is also highly punishable. anytime you see him go for the stomp you can simply roll through the attack and hit him 2-3 times in the back while he recovers. at 75% health godfrey will real back on one foot and charge up for his second phase where his attacks become stronger, particularly his stomp which now spreads across the entire boss arena. however none of that will matter if you punish godfrey when he is powering up. pay close attention to his health, and as soon as you see him rear back to change phases unleash everything you have on him. it is actually surprisingly easy to get 4-5 hits on him while he is reared back, giving plenty of time to burn the next 25% of his health (especially if you have bleed or freeze). "wait, why only 25%?" you may be wondering. well turns out our friend godfrey has one more secret hiding up his sleeve, his final form... godfrey tosses his weapons and armor aside to tear you apart with his bare hands in his final form as hoarah loux, warrior . hoarah loux is a much simpler fight in that he has far fewer moves than godfrey, but he uses them more relentlessly which makes it hard to find an opening. complicating things even further are hoarah loux's multiple grabs, which deal massive damage and need to be dodged rather than blocked. this fight is entirely about pattern recognition, learning the dodge timings for the grabs, and capitalizing on the few punish opportunities you get. the grabs you need to look out for are: hoarah loux swings his right arm around, then pauses for a moment before doing an uppercut motion to grab you then slam you into the ground. this one can be avoided by simply strafing around and rolling in at the moment of the grab. if you successfully roll through you can get 2-3 attacks on his back afterwards. hoarah loux crosses his arms in a sort of x, before dashing forward and clawing you with both hands. he launches you into the air, then slams you to the ground for big damage. again, you need to perfect the dodge timing and roll into the attack just before he claws you. this one is hard to punish because he usually slides far past you after, but it is a good chance to heal. hoarah loux raises both hands high into the air, before leaning down and scooping you into the air with both hands. this one has pretty deceptive timing, but as usual strafe around while you wait for the grab motion then roll through it and strike him in the back. this is the one he almost always opens the fight with. beyond the grabs, another move to keep an eye out for is the roar, which results in knockback and always chains into a follow up attack. two of these are jumping slam attacks, one low and one high. the low jump can be easily dodged by rolling in as he lands, then you can attack him 2-3 times as he stands up. the high jump can be dodged in a similar way, but hoarah loux follows it up with two earthquakes that hits the area around him. you can dodge through these quakes or jump over them if you have good timing, then maybe land 1-2 attacks as he stands up. he still employs the same stomp attack from phase one, but it is trickier this time around because he will often chain it into a second kick, spinning kick, or punch attack. if you see the stomp coming employ the same strafe and dodge strategy to get behind hoarah loux, but wait to see if he is going to chain it into a combo before you try and attack him. a lot of times there won't be any opening at all before he moves into his next attack, so stay on your toes! he rounds out his moveset with a number of different punch and kick combos, all of which deal moderate damage. i would recommend just rolling away or blocking all of these, as it is much easier to just wait out one of his slower attacks instead of trying to punish these. the one of these that is highly punishable is his two handed hammer fist. when you seem his raise his hands over his head and slam both down into the ground, simply strafe and roll around to get a few attacks on his back. he has one particularly long combo which he telegraphs by slowing raising one of his open hands behind his head as if he is about to uppercut, but instead lets loose a series of fast swipes. i recommend just backing away immediately and not even trying to block or dodge this one. at 25% health hoarah loux will do the same charging up animation as godfrey, leaving himself wide open for a major punish before he enters his final phase. just like godfrey this phase features most of the same attacks, just with new versions and wider ranges. rinse and repeat the same strategies we used in the first phase to finish this battle out and earn your reward, the remembrance of hoarah loux , the elden throne site of grace, and access to the final boss. walk up the stairs to the base of the erdtree and interact with the glowing barrier to trigger a cutscene, leading to our final challenge..! finally we have arrived, face to face with the famous radagon we have heard so much about. radagon is yet another powerful humanoid enemy, similar to godfrey in that he can be guard countered pretty heavily. however, his constant output of holy damage makes things a little more complicated, so you will need to keep tabs on your health and stamina at all times to avoid being beaten by one of his explosive attacks. most of radagon's movesets is made up of different mace swings, with a few magic spells mixed in for good measure. much like godfrey, our plan is to stay up in his face, shield up (barricade shield if you've got it), as much as possible to keep him swinging his mace and not throwing spells around. the first thing to note is that radagon stands motionless for the first 10-15 seconds of the fight. as soon as you spawn in immediately run at him and you can get in 3-4 attacks before he does anything. once the sight beings, here are a few attacks to look for: double mace swing (side to side) followed by an overhead slam. easy to block or dodge through, then punish with 2-3 attacks or a guard counter. occasionally follows this with a delayed fourth swing, which you can also guard counter after countering the third. diagonal swing, followed by a 360 swing. block or dodge, easy to guard counter as well. 360 swing spin swing into overhead slam. radagon spins around before the first hit, then charges up a holy mace slam. again, dodge roll as the attack comes in or block and guard counter the second hit. overhead holy slam. charges his mace with holy energy before slamming down. follows this immediately with a second slam or an uppercut. both are easily guard countered though you will eat some holy damage. uppercut into holy slam. swings mace up before grabbing with both hands and slamming it down. another easy guard counter if you don't mind the holy damage, or just strafe and dodge behind him. there is also a variant of this that is slower and both swings are holy charged. it is punishable in the same way. lightning bolt slam. after some of his combos radagon will leap into the air and summon a lightning bolt, which he then slams into the ground. this move looks punishable, but shortly after the lightning bolt will dissipate, causing damage from the ground around it. back away from the bolt as fast as you can. another highly punishable attack is his area of effect holy swing. he will lift up his foot and swing his mace back behind his head, charging it with holy energy, before doing a horizontal swing that causes the ground in front of him to start glowing, before exploding and dealing damage to you if you stand on it. thankfully you can just strafe around him then roll through the swing to dodge it, then hit him 3-4 times in the back while he recovers his posture. just like godfrey, radagon also has a stomp. one is a normal melee attack that pushes back, and another inflicts holy damage in a large area around him. if you see him lift his foot up to stomp and it begins glowing gold i recommend just guarding it. he will almost always follow this up by leaping into the air, before slamming back into the ground with a holy explosion. by rolling in just as he's about to hit the ground you can get behind him and sneak in 2-3 attacks as he is standing back up. if you get too far from him he will choose a few different attacks. he will jump and throw a lightning bolt, which explodes a few moments later. he will throw out a quick blast of holy energy that does a small amount of damage. or he can do a long range dash attack. the dash attack is the best case scenario, as you can dodge through and run up and attack him while he regains composure, but for the most part i just recommend staying close to him as much as possible. in one of his more intimidating attacks, radagon will slowly float above the ground, mace raised towards the sky, then he will fall back to earth and slam the mace into the ground, causing a burst of holy damage from the ground around him. he follows this with another quick slam before rising into the air again, then coming back down with a third and final smash. because of how overly dramatic the slams are they are incredibly easy to see coming and dodge. stay close to him, strafe around, and simply dodge through each of the slams. hit him in the back after the final slam for some free damage. when his missing arm begins to glow golden he is about to do his dashing grab attack, which deals massive damage if he snatches you. just like hoarah loux's grab attacks this one cannot be guarded, so you need to pay attention to the dash timing and dodge through it when he lunges forward to grab you. you can also avoid this attack by simply backing far away, but it is better to stay close and strafe around him. this will frequently cause him to lose tracking on you then dash in the wrong direction, leading to a free punish for you. finally, he has another variant of his high jumping slam where he sort of dashing through the air rather than jumping straight up. when he slams the ground after this attack it will result in an explosion of holy damage around him a few moments later, so be sure to step out of the glowing area on the ground. at about half health radagon will begin mixing teleports in between his attacks. he disappears then reappears a moment later, causing a burst of holy damage wherever he appears. this can make certain punishes less reliable as his teleport can be near instant, letting him avoid guard counters instantly. from this point i would stop countering and try to rely more on basic swing punishes for a little extra safety. keep up the punishes between teleports until you finally take him down. use his long death animation to heal up because we aren't done yet. finally the true final boss is revealed, the mysterious elden beast . he bears a resemblance to some of the large enemies we have encountered through the game, particularly astel, naturalborn of the void, but with a giant sword and full arsenal of powerful holy spells. thankfully the elden beast is pretty easy as far as final bosses go, so take a deep breath and get ready to wrap this game up! much like the dragon enemies we have battled in the past the best place to stand when attacking the elden beast is in its side, near the back legs. our basic strategy should be to try and bait the elden beast to do one of its slow, easily avoided melee attacks, then rush in and get as many attacks to its belly as you can before it swims away. thankfully the beast's sword swings are incredibly obvious and slow, so you can either put up your shield and simply block them, or just roll through to get to a closer position. another melee attack it likes to do is an arm thrust. the beast will summon a ball of light into its offhand, then thrust it forward towards you. like the sword swings, this attack is highly telegraphed and easily avoided by just rolling through the orb as it comes toward you. this is another great opportunity to take a few swings at the boss's belly. if the beast's mouth starts leaking flames you want to strafe and run away as fast as possible to avoid getting caught in the large area of effect fire breath. if you can move quickly enough to get behind the beast you can avoid it entirely. this is one of the beasts most damaging attacks, i wouldn't recommend trying to shield up and go toe to toe with it. the beast also has a few different perfume attacks, reminiscent of the ones astel used in his fight. he can spread the perfume in a forward line, or use it to create a wall in front of him. with both of these options simply step away from the perfume before it explodes to avoid the damage. the third perfume attack is a slam. the beast will summon a cloud of perfume in its offhand, then smack the ground to trigger an explosion. the best option here is just to roll away, then run back in for more attacks once the perfume fades. for the beast's final perfume attack, it will turn away from you and summon a giant cloud of perfume as it swims away. the perfume will hang in the air for a moment, then a golden flash will cause it to explode, dealing massive holy damage to you if you stand to close. the best strategy here is just to get away as soon as you see the cloud of perfume appear. the beast takes a moment to regain its composure after the explosion, so use that time to get back into attack range. perhaps the most dangerous melee attack is the beast's sword thrust, which it telegraphs by rearing back and grabbing the handle of the sword with both hands. it will point the blade toward the ground, then stick it into the ground, causing a massive explosion after 2-3 seconds. this is another instance where you will want to simply back away as quick as you can. when it gets far enough away the beast will choose between a few different attacks. one is a long range sword projectile, similar to the one maliketh used. just like maliketh's, these are easily dodged by just dodging toward the beast before the blades hit you. this will also let you quickly close the gap between you and the boss. another option is what i will refer to as the "ring" attack. the beast's body will glow and it will float into the air, summoning a golden ring in the sky. immediately look at the ground and you will soon see a golden ring forming around you as well. as it starts closing in on you run toward the edge. you want to jump over the ring and get outside the glowing circle before it explodes, dealing big damage. the most annoying attacks of all are the beast's two holy spells, which it will not hesitate to use whether you are close or far away. for one, it will run its hand along its sword, gathering holy energy in its hand before letting it loose. this ball of energy will chase you around the battlefield, letting off bits of holy shrapnel that deal small amount of damage. it will follow you for about 15-20 seconds before exploding. thankfully the shrapnel damage doesn't stun, so you can heal through it if needed. the best strategy here is just to keep moving away from the ball of energy, and keep dodging whatever other attacks the beast throws at you in the meantime. the other spell is similar, but far more dangerous. the beast's entire body will glow and it will spread out its wings, letting a bunch of holy missiles out of its back. these missiles will fly high into the sky, then come raining down on you all at once. if you stand in one spot the barrage will tear you apart in seconds, so just start running left or right to avoid the arrow rain, which thankfully only lasts about 5 seconds. the beast has a large healthpool, but if you stay on top of it and keep the attacks coming you will eventually take it down. your prize for defeating the final boss is the elden remembrance and a whole lotta runes. afterwards you will be deposited back to the stone platform where you battled radagon. approach his corpse to trigger the game's final cutscene and see your ending. congrats! /n spirit ashes are a mechanic in elden ring that allows you to summon various creatures to aid you in battle. as elden ring contains around 64 spirit ashes, it can be difficult to figure out which ones to use. this wiki page gives a brief overview of the top 5 spirit ashes in the game, as well as where to get them and what makes them so good. black knife tiche, the daughter of the black knife ringleader alecto who enacted the plot to steal the rune of death and slay godwyn, is a powerful and nimble ally to have on your side during combat. to receive these ashes, you must defeat alecto, black knife ringleader , in the ringleader's evergaol in liurnia of the lakes. to receive tiche's ashes , you will need to have access to the moonlight altar plateau, accessible only after defeating astel, naturalborn of the void in the deep ansel well . upon accessing this plateau, make your way to the northwest corner until you come across an evergaol. upon entering the evergaol and defeating alecto, you will receive her daughter's ashes. note that her fp cost is 132, so ensure you have enough focus points, or, conversely, nab the opaline bubbletear for your flask of wondrous physick to remote all fp consumption for a brief period of time. much like her mother and the other black knife assassins you have fought, tiche is incredibly nimble. she can function as both a source of damage as well as a meat shield, as her constant movement provides plenty of distraction for bosses. tiche wields a black knife imbued with the blade of death skill. this allows her to shoot a projectile from her weapon that temporarily reduces the maximum hp of whatever enemies are caught by her projectile. the mimic tear spirit ash is an exact copy of the player character at the moment of summoning. because of this, mimic tear can be an incredibly versatile ally, as you can customize it to fit your needs when going into battle. mimic tear can be found in a chest (behind an imp statue ) in the night's sacred ground , which is a subterranean location accessible from nokron, eternal city . to access this area specifically, head to the ancestral woods site of grace , then look to the southwest to see a rooftop to which you can jump. follow the rooftops downward, continuing in a southwest direction, until you begin running into silver tear enemies. continue northwest past them until the rooftops open up and reveal a courtyard with a large, skeleton woman sitting on a throne on the northeast end. continue across the crumbling path ahead of you and drop through the window before you. before dropping to the next platform, head around to the left until you see an imp statue . insert a stonesword key , vanquish the enemy therein, and grab the mimic tear ashes. how you choose to use mimic tear is very much up to your playstyle. if you are a low-vigor spellcaster, you can outfit yourself in your strongest armor and summon mimic tear to act as a damage sponge. conversely, if you tend to be an up-close melee fighter, setting your mimic tear up as a ranged build can be great for added dps. as mimic tear has unlimited ammo and fp when summoned, the latter is an excellent option as it therefore will never exhaust its resources. another important thing to note is that mimic tear uses whatever consumables you have equipped as well. this can be anything from buffing items to consumable weapons such as crystal darts. lhutel the headless is a tanky summons based on the enemy model of a mausoleum knight, with enough variation in her combat style to allow her to be a great option for a wide number of playstyles. she's also available much earlier in the game than some of the other spirit ashes on this list. lhutel's ashes can only be obtained by defeating the cemetery shade located at the end of the tombsward catacombs . to find these catacombs, head north of the minor erdtree on the weeping peninsula in limgrave , and make your way through the dungeon until you've unlocked the boss arena. upon defeating the cemetary shade, you will automatically receive these ashes. lhutel functions best as both a tank and damage dealer, thanks to her high defense (heavy armor and greatshield) as well as her varied offense (a mix of ranged and melee attacks). she's great for duo bosses or packs of enemies, as she will occasionally teleport, helping her avoid situations where she gets boxed in. however, lhutel's dps is fairly low, and the downside to her teleportation is that it means enemy aggro is reset. if you're looking for someone that will serve as a tanky distraction, lhutel may not be your best bet. latenna is one of the few spirit ashes in elden ring that actually starts out as an npc that you're able to meet, and appears to be the only one that becomes a summonable spirit by choice. while she requires a bit more strategic deployment than other ashes--thanks to the fact that she is unable to move freely once summoned--her turret-like dps is still a major boon when used wisely. to receive latenna's ashes , you must first speak with albus in the village of albinaurics in liurnia of the lakes . upon defeating the depraved perfumer in this location, roll into the pot located to the right of the tomb to reveal albus. upon exhausting his dialogue, he will give you the haligtree secret medallion (right) . without this sign of albus' blessing, latenna will not cooperate with the player or allow herself to become spirit ashes. to find her in her human form, you must make your way through the lakeside crystal cave on the southwest shore of liurnia. upon promising latenna you will take her to the haligtree, she willingly joins you as a summonable spirit ash. similar to other albinauric women, latenna has lost the use of her legs, so once summoned, she is unable to move freely. the only exception to this is if she's summoned near direwoves , as she will tame and ride one, which will not only grant her excellent agility, but will also unlock the use of the direwolf's frost breath. the best way to think of latenna (if there are no direwolves available in the summoning area) is as a static turret. she does massive dps with her fast fire rate of her arrows, but due to her lack of mobility, you will need to think strategically about her placement. in regards to field bosses, this means ensuring you're keeping the boss within range of her attacks; in more confined spaces like dungeon boss rooms, you need to ensure you continually draw aggro to ensure she is not quickly cut down by the boss. the greatshield soldiers ashes summon five greatshield soldier spirits. equipped with high poise and near-impenetrable shields, these ashes are an excellent option for spellcasters or glass cannon builds that require damage sponges to draw aggro. the greatshield soldiers ashes may be looted off of a corpse in a graveyard at the southernmost point of nokron, eternal city . note that there are several tough enemies along the way to these ashes; most notably a fallen hawks soldier equipped with a ghostflame torch . that being said, these may be worth trying to nab early for anyone starting out with a magic-heavy build. greatshield soldiers ashes are excellent options for any glass cannon magic builds. while they cannot be relied upon to dish out a ton of damage, their high poise, combined with their ability to use shield bash to stagger enemies, means they're the perfect meat shields and aggro sponges. note that they're not totally infallible, however, as certain heavy-hitting or highly nimble enemies will be able to make short work of them once they get through their defenses. /n throughout the lands between in elden ring, you'll encounter npc characters who will provide you with an assortment of side quests. on this page of our elden ring wiki guide , you'll find a list of all the characters, their questlines, and the outcomes of the choices you make. you'll find detailed elden ring side quest walkthroughs by clicking or tapping a character's name. below is a list of all the characters you can find in each area and details on where to find them to start their side quests. click or tap a name to be taken to an individual page with more details on their side quests.

in the church of irith character where to find them gowry gowry's shack in caelid millicent church of the plague character where to find them tanith volcano manor character where to find them jar-bairn jarburg/n alexander the iron fist is one of the many npcs you'll encounter that has a side quest to complete in elden ring. for this part of our elden ring wiki guide , you'll find details of where to find him, how to begin his questline, and the outcomes of your choices along the way. to find alexander the iron fist, head to the saintsbridge site of grace in the northern part of limgrave. head west, up the path, heading in the direction of the warmaster's shack . as you go through this path, you'll hear someone asking for help. head up the cliff, backtracking on yourself to go back towards saintsbridge as you do. when you reach the top, you'll see a pot sticking out from the ground. he will request that you hit him to get him out of his hole. regular attacks will not suffice, but a single heavy attack should be enough. be careful to not continue attacking once he's free, as that could cause him to aggro. he will then gift you exalted flesh by way of thanks. continue speaking to him until he mentions that he will next be heading to a festival held at redmane castle . at this point, you can make your way to that location in eastern caelid, or continue through limgrave to meet him at gael tunnel. alexander can be found in the gael tunnel, right on the border of limgrave and caelid. make your way down through the cave, platforming via the candlelit rock outcroppings to avoid falling to your death, until you reach the site of grace at the bottom. keep left throughout these tunnels until you enter a larger, open room with two doors. the one on the right will trigger the dungeon boss if you open it; instead, head to the left to open the door and find alexander, once again trapped (albeit this time by doors that can't accommodate his size). exhaust his dialogue here and then reload the area (we recommend beating the nearby boss to open a site of grace) to find he has moved, now granting you access to the rest of the tunnel that he had been blocking. to trigger alexander's appearance at redmane castle, you must have progressed ranni the witch's questline to the point that you have spoken to blaidd, sellen, and seluvis. more information on that can be found in the following walkthroughs: blaidd questline ranni the witch questline seluvis questline sorceress sellen questline optionally speak to him in the courtyard with the other npcs awaiting the festival, and then speak to castellan jerren to unlock the boss fight with starscourge radahn . we recommend summoning alexander for this fight, as it will cause him to appear in the boss arena after radahn has been defeated, allowing you to converse with him to learn his plans for where he'll be going next, as well as get some insight into how warrior jars are made. exhaust his dialogue here, and then continue through your game as normal. you will next meet alexander far to the west in liurnia of the lakes. you'll find alexander trapped again in liurnia of the lakes, just south of the carian study hall . he'll be crying out for help again, and ask you to smack him to get him out of the hole. when you do this twice, he'll say that his lower half is stuck on something, so hitting him won't work but you'll need something to slide him out. for this, you'll need an oil pot . you can craft these if you've purchased the nomadic warrior's cookbook [17 ] from the merchant in siofra river . you'll need melted mushrooms and a cracked pot to craft one. throw the oil pot at alexander, then hit him again until he pops out of the hole. he'll give you three exalted flesh as a reward and tells you that he'll head to the fiery mount in the north. the next time you encounter him will be in mt. gelmir, located to the far west on the atlus plateau. on the eastern side of mt. gelmir , by the lava pool just past volcano manor , you can find a magma wyrm . alexander is in the pool of lava, towards the east by the mountain. speaking to him here will grant you the jar helmet, as well as reveal his plans to head eastward to his final location, crumbling farum azula . at this point, you will need to progress the game considerably further, past the mountaintops of the giants, until you reach the floating island of farum azula. to find alexander in this location, you will need two stonesword keys to activate the dragon temple lift . head north following the godskin duo fight and platform across the broken structures until you see the imp statue seal that will unlock the lift. go up the lift and make your way through the courtyard of undead beasts until you reach a flight of stairs upward. hang to the right until you see a path to the far cliff on the western side made by broken, traversable ruins. follow these, continuing in a westerly direction, until you see alexander in the distance, on a large, floating broken ruin. he will lament the number of times he needed you to save him and will request a duel so that he may feel like a true warrior. this is the unavoidable end to alexander's questline. fight him here and defeat him to receive the shard of alexander and alexander's innards key items, the latter of which can be used in the jar-bairn questline . /n boc is one of the many npcs you'll encounter that has a side quest to complete in elden ring. for this part of our elden ring guide, you'll find details of where to find him, how to begin his questline, and the consequences of any choices you make along the way. when you first meet boc, you'll hear him before you see him. follow the road around the north tip of agheel lake, until it curves back around to the south. keep an eye on the lefthand side of the path; once you see a telescope near the road, you should also hear a voice calling out to you. look to the east to spot an item sitting in a field. scout just beyond the item to see a small, reddish shrublike tree in front of a copse of trees. roll into it to reveal that it is actually boc, who will realize that he had been turned into a tree by an unidentified assailant. talk to him and he'll tell you that he was pushed out of a cave. he'll give you mushrooms and then tell you that he'll sneak into the cave. the next place you'll be able to find boc is in the coastal cave . when you arrive, you'll find boc by the site of grace in bad shape. you'll need to head inside and fight a boss battle against two demi-human chiefs to recover boc's sewing needle and tailoring tools . go back to boc once you've completed the battle and give the sewing needle to boc. boc will be inspired to live on and become a seamster and leave the cave behind, while you are able to keep the tailoring tools to alter certain armor while resting at a site of grace - which can remove cloaks and lower armor and weight values. continue through your game until you reach liurnia, at which point you'll find him again in at the site of grace by the church of irith. when you speak to him here, he'll say that he can make adjustments to your garments. while you can do so yourself, asking him to alter your armor will be free of charge, rather than the 500 runes you have to spend each time you alter armor on your own. to get him to continue to his next location, you must ensure you have done the following: once all three conditions have been met, you will be able to give him the gold needle, which will both allow him to now alter legendary armor, as well as unlock the ability to continue his quest. once you've spoken to boc near the church of irith, he'll appear again at the east raya lucaria gate site of grace near the academy of raya lucaria . here, he will offer the same services as before, such as minor garment alterations. boc's final (or penultimate, depending on what you decide to do next) location is at the east capital rampart site of grace. rest at this location to get boc to appear here. exhaust his dialogue about the erdtree to open up your three branching options to resolve his questline. if you give boc nothing, he will express remorse at his looks, and talk about how he wishes to be rebirthed by rennala . upon reloading the area, you will find that he has disappeared. unfortunately, as he did not have the requisite larval tear to visit rennala, he appears to have instead set out on his own journey to become beautiful. at this point, he cannot be found again until ng+ if you instead choose the option to give boc a larval tear , he will express his thanks, that he may now be reborn through rennala. at this point, you must exhaust his dialogue and then reload the area and find he has moved. note that if you go this route, you will irreversibly doom him to death. upon fast traveling to the raya lucaria grand library site of grace (where rennala is located), you will find boc, now in his rebirthed human form. he will, however, be unresponsive. if you reload the area, either through resting at the site of grace or leaving and later returning, you will find that he has died. to keep boc from dying or disappearing, you must use the "you're beautiful" prattling pate . upon exhausting his dialogue concerning his wishes to change his looks, open your inventory and use the "you're beautiful" while standing in front of him. if you have not yet found it, explore the hermit's village southeast of mt. gelmir and explore the houses until you see a large item icon on a corpse on a house's front porch. more information on its exact location can be found on the hermit village page of this wiki. upon using this in front of him and speaking to him again, boc will express profound gratitude at your reassurances concerning his looks. he will happily continue to serve you as elden lord, and will remain at this location until ng+. /n blaidd is one of the many npcs you'll encounter that has a side quest to complete in elden ring. for this part of our elden ring guide, you'll find details of how to find blaidd, how to begin his questline, and the outcomes of your choices. blaidd's questline is heavily entwined with ranni's questline, which is one of the main stories in the game. because of this, the titles on each step of his quest have been left deliberately vague to avoid potential spoilers. click or tap on one of the links below to jump to a section in blaidd's side quest on this page. finding blaidd the target third meeting meeting at the river the festival the prison the city the tower to find blaidd, you'll need to head to limgrave's mistwood ruins at night. if this spot isn’t on your map yet, you’ll find it on the west side of the forest road, northwest of the nomadic merchant in the area. you won't be able to talk to him just yet. carefully approach the mistwood ruins (there’s a sleeping bear you don’t need to wake) and you should see a tower on the north side of the ruins. up on top is blaidd, howling. after you’ve clearly heard a wolf howl, you'll have unlocked a dialogue option with the merchant kalé at limgrave’s church of elleh. visit kalé and ask him about the howling. he’ll tell you a little bit about blaidd and teaches you the finger snapping gesture which is required to get blaidd's attention. return to the mistwood ruins and use the finger snap gesture when you hear the wolf howl. this will summon blaidd. start a conversation with him and he'll tell you that he's looking for dariwil. this is one of the bosses in one of the many evergaols scattered throughout the lands between. continue through your game, making your way to the southern part of limgrave to reach the next step in blaidd's quest. head to limgrave’s forlorn hound evergaol, located just before the weeping peninsula, to find that you may summon blaidd to help in the battle against the bloodhound knight darriwil . for ease of reference and travel, the nearest site of grace to the evergaol is agheel lake south . once you've defeated darriwil, you can talk to blaidd to claim your prize of a somber smithing stone [2] . chat with him some more and he'll tell you about a blacksmith you can find named iji , located in northwest liurnia. once you've made it through caria manor and unlocked the three sisters in the north of liurnia, head to the westernmost one called ranni's rise . here you will meet ranni, officially kicking off the ranni the witch questline . as part of this, she'll summon blaidd (along with seluvis and iji) and ask you to speak to him - you'll be able to find him downstairs as you make your way back down from the top of the tower. after a short discussion with him, he'll ask you to meet him in siofra river . from this point, blaidd's questline becomes intertwined with the following npc's sidequests: alexander the iron fist questline seluvis questline sorceress sellen questline head to siofra river and find blaidd just north of the southernmost hallowhorn grounds in siofra river, standing near a cliff below the aqueduct above. exhaust the dialogue options with him and he'll tell you that he thinks seluvis knows more about accessing nokron, eternal city than he's pretending. head back to seluvis's rise (and if you haven't already spoken to him, speaking to him now will initiate the seluvis questline .) seluvis will tell you that sellen may have some information, and will give you the seluvis's introduction key item to take to sellen and learn more. sellen will tell you that starscourge radahn is the key to unlocking nokron, but as he holds the stars, you'll need to defeat him to gain access to it. if you've been looking for the festival that alexander the iron fist mentioned in his questline, the conversation with seluvis is the only way to trigger it. once you learn this information about radahn, you'll be able to return to blaidd. he says he'll meet you at redmane castle to fight alongside you against radahn. at this point, to continue his quest, head southeast to caelid to find the aforementioned castle. when you reach the courtyard, you'll see numerous npcs gathered, including blaidd and alexander the iron fist. head up the stairs, and speak to castellen jerren to initiate the festival via a brief cutscene offering insight into the plight of general radahn. note that the doors to enter radahn's boss battle won't open unless you speak to him, so you will need to repeat this process each time you activate this fight. proceed through the doors up the stairs, taking the one directly behind the chair, then going to the right to take a lift down to a teleporter that will take you over to the boss battle with radahn. here you'll be able to summon a number of npcs to help in the fight against him. when you've defeated radahn, talk to blaidd. he'll tell you that you should meet "where the falling star bit the earth". note that this location will be marked with a red stamp on your map, and can be found near the mistwood ruins in limgrave. defeating radahn not only progresses blaidd's questline, but also is necessary to progress the following npc stories: ranni the witch questline sorceress sellen questline alexander the iron fist questline return to the forlorn hound evergaol where you originally fought the bloodhound knight darriwil. approach the area to hear a familiar howling sound, followed by blaidd identifying himself and explaining that iji trapped him in there. at this point, you are given the option to help him or not. the only way to progress his questline is to free him from his imprisonment. upon setting him free, blaidd will tell you that he must return to the three sisters to ensure ranni is safe. note, however, that if you return to this location, blaidd will be nowhere to be found. instead, proceed to the crater formed by the falling star to reach a new underground area and find the next leg of blaidd's quest. if you have been following both blaidd and ranni's questline, this should be the next location where you encounter blaidd. when you've reached the nokstella site of grace , follow the path along the floor. when you reach a building in the south, enter it and take the lift down to the next level below. this will take you to the nokstella waterfall basin site of grace . if you rest here, you can talk to ranni some more via a new option that appears while sitting at the site of grace. from here, continue forward towards the eggs and follow the path around to the red room. you’ll be invaded by a baleful shadow here that resembles blaidd. fight this invader and ranni will thank you, saying farewell and giving you the discarded palace key. (this can be used to open rennalla’s locked chest in the grand library, where you’ll receive the dark moon ring key item). your final interaction with blaidd will occur if you decide to return to ranni's rise at the end of the ranni the witch questline . approach the entrance to the rise to hear blaidd mumbling incoherently, bent over the corpse of a black knife assassin . exiting the rise (or getting within aggro distance when approaching from the east) will cause blaidd to attack you; it appears he went insane just as iji feared, seemingly due to his heartbreak that he was not ranni's chosen consort. unfortunately, there is no way to de-aggro him or avoid this fate. if you defeat him, he'll drop: royal greatsword blaidd's armor blaidd's gauntlets blaidd's greaves/n bloody finger hunter yura is one of the many npcs you'll encounter that has a side quest to complete in elden ring. for this part of our elden ring guide, you'll find details of where to find him, how to begin his questline, and the consequences of any choices you make along the way. to find bloody finger hunter yura for the first time and kick off his quest, you can meet him in two possible locations. it doesn't matter which one you choose, although you'll be presented with slightly different dialogue options depending on the route you take. head to the seaside ruins south of the dragon-burnt ruins and head due east from the site of grace located here. you will find yura underneath an alcove made by a crumbled ruin. he will introduce himself and advise you to not try to take on the dragon living in the aforementioned dragon-burnt ruins. naturally, at this point you should plan to head north and return to these ruins to take on flying dragon agheel . upon defeating this field boss, you will receive a dragon heart key item. bring this to yura at the coastal ruins to progress his questline and learn about the church of dragon communion, located on an island southwest of limgrave and accessible via the coastal cave dungeon. another option for your first meeting with yura is to head along the river that feeds into agheel's lake from the north. as you make your way up this waterway, you will be invaded by the npc bloody finger nerijus . after fighting him for a bit, you will get a message that bloody finger hunter yura has come to aid you in battle. upon besting nerijus, continue north along this river until you find yura on the righthand bank, underneath an outcropping of stone. he will introduce himself and explain the concept of the bloody fingers. when you reach the academy main gate, there will be a red summoning sign for bloody finger hunter yura to the northeast. yura will require your help to beat bloody finger ravenmount assassin and will transport you to his world. after this battle, bloody finger hunter yura will appear on the bridge near the academy. speak to bloody finger hunter yura and he'll give you a smithing stone [5] . he will also hint at the next part of his quest, mentioning that he has been tracking the deadliest bloody finger for some time, eleonora. at this point, there is nothing further you can do with him, so continue through your game until you reach the altus plateau. the next time you see bloody finger hunter yura, he'll be on the floor of the second church of marika in west altus plateau. speak to him and he'll say that he's no match for eleonora. he'll then die, rewarding you with a nagakiba . following his death, eleanora, violet bloody finger will invade you immediately. she is a considerable foe, but managing to kill her will reward you with a purifying crystal tear and eleonora's poleblade . however, this is the last that you will see of yura's soul, although his possessed body makes an appearance later on. yura can make another appearance later on in the game, when you reach the mountaintops of the giants . for him to appear, you must defeat mohg, the omen as battling this boss leads to the discovery of the three fingers and the opportunity to discover the frenzied flame . from here, yura's corporeal form can be met at the zamor ruins site of grace . he will explain that the yura that you once knew is dead, and that the form standing before you is none other than the infamous shabriri , of the grape fame. yura/shabriri will then encourage you to seek the three fingers and embrace the frenzied flame . /n d, hunter of the dead is one of the many npcs you'll encounter that has a side quest to complete in elden ring. for this part of our elden ring wiki guide , you'll find details of where to find him, how to begin his questline, and the outcome of the choices you make along the way. the first place you may encounter d in the west limgrave area. head to summonwater village outskirts and you'll spot d standing over a dead body. he'll warn you about the dangers of summonwater village and suggest you stay away. while you're free to heed his warning, continuing into the village will reveal the tibia mariner field boss, whose defeat will provide a crucial item required for progressing d's storyline. defeating the tibia mariner and reloading the area without traveling to the roundtable hold will cause d to move to be near the southwest side of summonwater village. whether you choose to show him the deathroot here or at the hold, he will have the same dialogue concerning gurranq, as outlined below. if you are unable to find d in limgrave, he will eventually appear at the roundtable hold, although the exact trigger to get him to relocate is unknown. to progress his questline, however, you will still need to show him a deathroot, either from a tibia mariner field boss (the easiest one to reach at this point is the one near d's initial location in east limgrave) or any of the other locations listed in the table below. after securing your first deathroot, you'll have the option to show it to him at which point he'll tell you that you should meet the beast clergyman gurranq. he'll leave a red mark on your map that will allow you to teleport to the beastial sanctum in caelid . upon reaching this location, you'll find a hooded, catlike figure that will angrily demand you feed him deathroot; doing so will reward you with various spells and items as listed below. the first reward will include the clawmark seal , as well as an item that will alert you when you are near the presence of deathroot. seek out the following locations to find deathroot by defeating either field bosses, or those who live in death that hide in certain dungeons: deathtouched catacombs - west limgrave, defeat the black knife assassin and loot the chest in the room. summonwater village - east limgrave, defeat the tibia mariner on the north side of the zone. southwest of the carian study hall - east liurnia, defeat the tibia mariner located along the main ridge road going towards the divine tower of liurnia black knife catacombs - east liurnia, defeat the cemetery shade and loot the chest in the room. wyndham ruins - altus plateau, defeat the tibia mariner located at the ruins. gelmir hero's grave - mt gelmir, defeat the red wolf of the champion and loot the chest in the room. stargazer's ruins - mountaintop of the giants, defeat the tibia mariner located at the ruins. giant's mountaintop catacombs - defeat the dungeon boss of this catacomb to receive a deathroot. hidden path to the haligtree - defeat the ulcerated tree spirit field boss in this dungeon. deathroot given item reward first deathroot clawmark seal (incantation catalyst) second deathroot bestial sling spell third deathroot bestial vitality spell fourth deathroot ash of war - beast's roar fifth deathroot beast claw spell sixth deathroot stone of gurranq spell seventh deathroot beastclaw greathammer eighth deathroot gurranq's beast claw final deathroot ancient dragon smithing stone warning - after giving gurranq around three deathroots, he will go temporarily insane and attack you the next time you visit. you'll have to fight him and shave off a bit of his health before he comes to his senses, and will back down. if you're having trouble with his relentless attacks, you can try luring the hm outside to attack through the doorway and hit him. here is where d's story intertwines with fia's questline . after receiving the cursemark of death from carian hall, speak with fia using the "talk in secret" dialogue prompt. she will give you a weathered dagger and ask you to return it to its owner. speak to d and he will express his surprise that you have the dagger, but will agree to return it to its owner. reload the area and head to the hallway near master hewg and roderika to find the far doorway is open. upon entering the room, you will find fia standing over d's corpse, having apparently killed him. fia will admit to her treachery and her status as a deathbed companion, and then disappear from the roundtable hold. at this point, d's quest ends, and you are no longer able to purchase incantations with him. however, you still have the option to exact vengeance upon fia through the help of d's twin brother. once you have made your way to nokron, rest at the ancient grounds site of grace, then head north, further along the cliff until you see a buttress you can traverse down to the area below. head through the aqueduct, to the far side, until you see a pale figure sitting near a set of covered stairs leading upward into an arena. this is d's younger brother. if you took it off of d's corpse, you now have the option to give d's brother the twinned armor set. this will reveal to him that d has been killed, and will cause him to show up later on if you choose to continue to pursue fia's quest. /n kenneth haight is one of the many npcs you'll encounter that has an optional side quest in elden ring. for this part of our elden ring guide, you'll find details of where to find this npc, how to begin his questline, and the outcomes of whatever choices to make along the way to completing this quest. head northeast from the mistwood outskirts, until you see a large crumbling ruin that creates a partial bridge. as you approach, you will be able to hear someone ask if you'd like to help the great kenneth haight. make your way to the top (being sure not to let any enemies follow you up, which could result in kenneth haight's death and a premature end to his questline. however, it's worth noting that he drops a golden seed upon death). upon speaking to him, he will ask you to take back his ancestral fort, fort haight. to progress his quest, you must agree to pledge your service to him (this will not lock you out of any other npc questlines or have any impact on storylines). pledge to serve him and then head southeast to the tip of the eastern limgrave region to find fort haight. upon clearing the enemies from the fort, reload the area to find kenneth haight standing near the top of the fort. he will rescind his offer to make you a knight, and then mention that he must find a new lord to replace godrick the grafted . upon reloading the area yet again, he will have moved to his final location in stormveil castle. for kenneth haight to appear in his final location, the following conditions must be met: upon the completion of the above criteria, kenneth haight and nephali loux may both be found in the throne room in stormveil castle (just beyond the godrick, the grafted site of grace ). speaking to kenneth haight will reveal he's he's chosen a new ruler - lady nepheli. speaking to nepheli will prompt her to thank you for your help; keep talking to her to receive an ancient dragon smithing stone . she says that if you become elden lord, she will lighten the burden. kenneth haight and nepheli loux moving to the throne room at stormveil castle will also allow you to interact with gatekeeper gostoc and access his shop, where you may purchase an ancient dragon smithing stone for 20,000 runes. /n nepheli loux is one of the many npcs you'll encounter that has a side quest to complete in elden ring. for this part of our elden ring guide, you'll find details of where to find her, how to begin her questline, as well as the outcomes of any choices you make along the way. you'll first encounter nepheli loux in stormveil castle, just before the battle with godrick the grafted . you can find her just before the secluded cell, in a room to the right as you make your way through the barricades and warhawks, just before the golden sapling . be extra sure that none of the footsoldiers in this area follow you into this room, as they may easily aggro or kill her in such a confined space. speak to nepheli and she'll explain that sir gideon ofnir is her foster father and she's been sent to slay godrick the grafted . exhaust her dialogue here and head to the godrick fight to find her summons sign on the ground near the golden fog leading to his boss arena. note that summoning her is optional; it has no bearing on her quest, and if you choose to summon her and she dies, she will remain alive in your world. after defeating godrick, nepehli can be found at roundtable hold . to get her to spawn in this location, you must exhaust sir gideon ofnir's dialogue while he is standing in his initial spot near the roundtable hold site of grace. upon doing so and reloading the area, gideon will have moved into his study and nepheli will appear in the alcove just past the door to his room. she'll give you an arsenal charm . exhaust her dialogue then reload the area to find she's taken her leave. continue through your game until you reach liurnia of the lakes, then head to the southwest shoreline of the lake until you reach the village of the albinaurics. the entrance will be identifiable by the lake becoming a poisonous swamp, and the large number of crabs patrolling the area. as usual, be sure none of these follow you on the path up to the village, as they may accidentally aggro or kill nepheli. you will find her here, crouched under the stone bridge just before the village, staring at a pile of corpses on the ground. speak to her here and exhaust her dialogue to get her to return to roundtable hold. return to the rountable hold and head down the stairs near master hewg to find nepheli crouching on the ground. at this point, she will simply ask to be left alone; you will be unable to progress her quest further until you have visited the chapel of anticipation to retrieve the stormhawk king spirit ashes . if you have no interest in progressing her questline, this is also the location in which you may give her seluvis's potion , as outlined below. when you begin the ranni the witch questline , you can unlock a location in renna's rise called seluvis's tower . when you visit seluvis in his tower, he will ask you to take a potion and give it to nepheli loux, which marks the beginning of the seluvis questline . travel back to the roundtable hold and you'll find nepheli downstairs. to continue this quest, you must speak to gideon, wherein a new dialogue option will appear, allowing you to choose to tell him about the potion or not. during this discussion, he'll offer you the choice of giving him the potion to dispose of, or doing as seluvis wishes and giving it to nepheli. if you choose the former, you will still be able to complete seluvis' quest, but you will save nepheli from her fate of becoming a summonable puppet spirit ash. you can return to seluvis, however, and as gideon hints when he disposes of the potion, tell seluvis that you've given the potion to nepheli as he requested. this should unlock the ability to learn incantations from seluvis. assuming you did not give nepheli the potion, you can get her to move to her final location by giving her the stormhawk king spirit ashes . to do so, you will need to return to the very starting area of the game. you can do this one of two ways: as part of the white-faced varre questline , or by using an imbued stonesword key on the sending gates labeled "the precipice of anticipation" in the four belfries . either way, defeat the grafted scion here to open up the area for exploration and grab the ashes before heading back to the roundtable hold. these ashes can be found at the very top of the chapel, in a chest behind a previously locked door. return to nepheli and give her the spirit ashes to unlock new dialogue and prompt her to move to her final location. before continuing on, reload the roundtable hold area and return to where she was sitting to retrieve 2 x stormhawk axes . to get nepheli to move back to stormveil castle, you'll need to have progressed the kenneth haight questline to the point where kenneth haight has returned to his fort in limgrave and said that he will search for a new leader. if both kenneth's and nepheli's conditions are met, you will be able to find them in the throne room in stormveil castle (just beyond the godrick, the grafted site of grace ). speak to nepheli here and she'll thank you for your help and tell you that she's left her foster father gideon. keep talking to her and she'll give you an ancient dragon smithing stone . she says that if you become elden lord, she will lighten the burden. at this point, her quest is officially at an end. /n patches is one of the many npcs you'll encounter that has a side quest to complete in elden ring. for this part of our elden ring guide , you'll find details of where to find him, how to begin his questline, and the outcome of the choices you make along the way. in limgrave (first encounter) in liurnia at mt. gelmir at volcano manor in the shaded castle back to limgrave you'll first find patches in murkwater cave in limgrave. upon entering the final cavern of this cave, you will find it empty save for a chest. upon opening it, you will hear a voice call out to you, shaming you for assuming you could simply take any treasure you find. at this point, patches will drop down from a ledge behind you and his boss health bar will appear on your screen. engage him in combat until he is at approximately 1/4 hp, at which point he will beg for you to let him surrender. here you have two options. kill patches: if you choose to continue the fight, he will begin to fight you again. at this point, you have no choice but to end the fight with death, as he will not return to his pacified state during this time. upon killing him, you will receive his unique armor as well as his +7 spear , which is a strong weapon early in the game. you will also receive the patches bell bearing key item, which can be taken to the twin maiden husks in the roundtable hold to unlock his merchant inventory. however, this will end his questline. let patches live: if you stop attacking patches when he grovels and begs for mercy (thereby teaching you the grovel for mercy gesture), his boss health bar will disappear after a few seconds, and you will be able to speak to him. he will ask for your forgiveness. regardless of your answer, he will now act as a merchant at this location. assuming you chose to let patches live, reload the area to find that a new chest as appeared next to patches. this is a teleporter trap that will take you near the mistwood outskirts in limgrave. you'll need to interact with a site of grace before you can fast travel again (the closest site of grace is the mistwood outskirts, just northwest of your destination location). return to murkwater cave and speak to him again; exhaust his dialogue here to get him to move to his next location. go to the scenic isle in liurnia, to see patches again. he'll sell a few additional items, including an estoc. here you can talk to him about both the rya questline as well as the abductor virgins at the bottom of the academy of raya lucaria . the specific abductor virgin he mentions will transport you to a dungeon below volcano manor, and you'll have to navigate this lava-filled cavern to escape - see our guide for more information . note that this interaction is not necessary to progress his questline--if you miss him here, he will still automatically move to mt. gelmir as soon as you rest at a site of grace on the altus plateau. patches will appear again later at mt. gelmir . you can find him northwest of the first mt. gelmir campsite site of grace . you'll see a line of rainbow stones leading towards a cliff's edge. speak to patches who is hiding in the bush and he'll encourage you to look at the shimmering stones (you can also just trigger the next action by heading past patches and getting too close to the edge of the cliff). here, a cutscene will begin where patches will kick you off the cliff and tell you to stay away from volcano manor . go back to him and he'll apologize and repeat his warning to stay clear of volcano manor . when you've reached volcano manor , talk to tanith and begin the tanith questline to join the volcano manor . after speaking to tanith (regardless of whether or not you choose to join her), patches will now appear in the entrance hallway. he'll have an expanded merchant inventory here (including great arrows and ballista bolts ); you will also now have a dialogue prompt to ask him more about himself. when you've completed a volcano manor assassination, you'll also be able to receive a letter to patches from him that has a special assassination request. upon fulfilling his request to assassinate great horned tragoth near the ruin-strewn precipice , return to patches and ask what the reward is for completing his mission. he'll hand over a magma whip candlestick . once you've completed volcano manor and killed rykard, lord of blasphemy you can speak to him again and he'll say goodbye. continue through your journey until you reach the shaded castle, located in the cove on the northern shore of the altus plateau. head up the lift from the shaded castle inner gate site of grace , until you reach a long hallway dotted with statues, at the end of which is a golden fog indicating a boss room (elemer of the briar, in this instance). look to the left to see patches reclining against the wall. speak to him here and he'll give you dancer's castanets to give to tanith, whom you can find in rykard's chamber (note that giving them to her appears to have no effect on either her or patches' questlines). he seems to die at this point; however, he drops no items here, and his body disappears if you reset the area. head back to the murkwater cave in limgrave to find him again. attempting to access to his arena will reveal that the boss fog has returned. traverse the mist and interact with the now-closed chest. patches will once again drop down to the ground with a boss hp bar and attempt to attack you. after hitting him only 2-3 times, he will recognize you and stop fighting. if you hold off on attacking him, he'll give you the patches' crouch gesture. upon reloading the area, patches will open up his emporium again, allowing you to access his shop and all the items he's previously sold. note that at this point, his merchant inventory has not expanded from anything he offered previously at volcano manor. this appears to officially end his questline, as he will continue to stay in this location as a merchant. /n roderika is one of the many npcs you'll encounter that has a side quest to complete in elden ring. for this part of our elden ring guide, you'll find details of where to find her, how to begin her questline, and the outcomes of your choices along the way. you'll first encounter roderika in stormhill shack in west limgrave. to get here, head northwest from the gatefront ruins site of grace , following the path upward until you reach an open field. you'll know you're near the right location when a pack of wolves descends from the sky. activate the stormhill shack site of grace, then head into the building to find her sitting on the floor. speak to her until she gives you the spirit jellyfish ashes , followed by a request that you go to stormveil castle . to progress her quest, you must not only reach the castle, but also retrieve the key item called the chrysalids' memento . head east from the rampart tower site of grace on the western side of the castle. continue along the ramparts until you reach the room with the grafted scion enemy. go through the south door of the room to find a courtyard with two dogs and a pile of corpses, upon which will be the chysalids' memento . pick this up and return to roderika. reload the area to find she has moved to her second location. at the roundtable hold, speak to roderika and then speak to smithing master hewg. go back and forth between the two, choosing the novel dialogue option that will pop up each time, until hewg reluctantly agrees to mentor roderika. this will unlock the ability for roderika to become a spirit tuning apprentice (mechanics-wise, this means she is now a vendor that will level up your spirit ashes ). reload the area to find that she has relocated away from the fireplace in the main room, and is instead now seated on the floor opposite of master hewg. this is where she will remain throughout the rest of the game. note that it is worth keeping an eye on both her and hewg's dialogue options, as they will occasionally offer lore or conversation topics as you progress your game. /n rogier is one of the many npcs you'll encounter that has a side quest to complete in elden ring. for this part of our elden ring guide, you'll find details of where to find this npc, how to begin their questline and the outcomes of your choices. rogier can initially be found in stormveil castle . from rampart tower, if you take the stairs down and cross the rooftops until you reach the ladder, you can go either left or right. if you go right, you'll head towards the grafted scion, but if you go left, you'll be able to find rogier. once you've defeated godrick the grafted rogier will move to the roundtable hold. when you speak to him, you'll receive rogier's rapier+8 . to progress his questline, you must next find his bloodstain. from the liftside chamber site of grace , exit east and take a sharp right, doubling back on yourself. drop down from where the body is sitting on the ledge. continue downward and make your way through a corpse- and rat-filled ditch. follow this until you reach the ulcerated tree spirit boss . to safely access rogier's bloodstain, you will need to defeat it. further on along the boss arena, you will find a grotesque face in the ground, and to the right of it, a bloodstain. if you interact with it, you'll see rogier being killed. return to rogier and choose "talk" to prompt him to discuss his feelings of soon falling into a deep slumber. when you speak to rogier, he'll say that he thinks he might fall into a great sleep soon and after finding his bloodstain, he will. when you return, he'll eventually be dead. if this happens, you'll receive: his bell bearing that you can give to the twin maiden husks spellblade's pointed hat spellblade's travelling attire spellblade's gloves spellblade's trousers interact with him again and you'll also receive a letter that says: "i forgot to tell you, but it seems d has a younger brother. i heard he lies in a deep sleep in the aqueduct beside the eternal city of nokron. and it's said he stood before the prince of death not far beyond that spot." this is where you'll need to head to progress the fia questline . if you return to rogier after you've seen the bloodstain, you can talk to him and he'll provide you with some lore surrounding godfrey. he'll also explain that he's been looking for black knifeprints. if you have a black knifeprint (you can pick one up from the black knife assassin boss in the black knight catacombs ) you can give this to him. leave the roundtable hold and come back. rogier will be finished with his examination of the black knifeprint, concluding that ranni is behind the slaying of godfrey. as a result, ranni should have a cursemark on her body. rogier asks you to procure the cursemark for him and you can ask about her whereabouts and why he wants the cursemark. the next step is to head to caria manor , in the northwest of liurnia. you'll need to clear caria manor by defeating royal knight loretta to access the three sisters subregion, where ranni's rise is located. when you get to ranni's rise and speak to her. she'll say she doesn't remember inviting you and if you've exhausted all of rogier's dialogue, the option will come up that says "you must be ranni the witch, behind the night of the black knives." choose this and ranni will tell you she cast off the cursemark with her old body. you can ask where the body went but she won't tell you and will tell you to leave. return to rogier and tell him that ranni cast off her cursemark. he'll send you back to ranni again and tell you to convince her to let you be her vassal, while continuing to find information for rogier. while ranni will not be fooled, she will nevertheless allow you to serve her, thus beginning the ranni the witch questline . unfortunately, if rogier has not yet died in your world, this conversation officially signals his passing; once you return to him, you will find that he has expired. /n sorceress sellen is one of the many npcs you'll encounter that has a side quest to complete in elden ring. for this part of our elden ring guide, you'll find details of where to find her, how to begin her questline, and the consequences of the choices you make along the way. at the waypoint ruins azur at mt. gelmir lusat at sellia hideaway after the festival at the witchbane ruins in the secret chamber back to caelid the final battle the transformation sorceress sellen can initially be found in waypoint ruins in limgrave. you'll need to fight a pumpkin head boss to gain access to her room, found at the back of this small underground arena. proceed through the door and introduce yourself to sorceress sellen. she reveals she’s an outcast, but one who is willing to teach you sorcery. accept her offer to become her apprentice. as you find glintstone sorcery scrolls, be sure to give them to her to unlock new sorcery options. see also : magic spells - sorceries and incantations the best spells legendary spells from here, you will need to continue your own journey of the world until you reach the mt. gelmir region of the altus plateau. here you will find the necessary key item that will allow you to progress sellen's quest. head to the hermit village in mt. gelmir, and progress to the furthermost end of it to find a site of grace called primeval sorcerer azur . here, you'll be able to speak to the primeval sorcerer azur, who will give you azur's comet . note that outside of receiving azur's comet, you have no further interaction options with azur. return to sellen in the waypoint ruins and choose the new dialogue option "show azur's sorcery." azur was sellen's first teacher, and she says that he must see something in you to give you the comet. you can press sellen, asking her to tell you her story. she covers how she was exiled from the academy of raya lucaria and asks for you to help with the primal glintstone . you can either choose "let us journey together" or "let me think about it." if you choose to take the journey with sellen, she will ask you to find master lusat and will give you the sellian selbreaker. finally, if you're unsure of where to go from here, you can talk to her further, asking for a lead on lusat. she will tell you he returned to his home, in sellia, town of sorcery . sellia, town of sorcery and, more specifically, to the sellia hideaway . this is hidden behind an illusory wall just southwest of fort faroth in caelid, the closest site of grace being the church of the plague . go inside, and look for the hidden path along the northwest part of the cavern. full information on how to traverse this dungeon can be found on the sellia hideaway page of this guide. at the very bottom of the cave, you will find a large blue seal, similar to the ones used to seal off the entrances to raya lucaria. approach it to see a prompt appear to use the sellian sealbreaker . doing so will break the seal and allow you into the room where you will find lusat. speaking to them here will grant you the stars of ruin . return to the waypoint ruins (you can fast travel there from lusat's location) and tell sellen where lusat is located. she'll give you some starlight shards in return, and then will mention in passing that she believes the bodies of lusat and azur need to be taken back to the academy, and that she wishes she could do it "if only i could undo those shackles." at this point, you'll need to have defeated starscourge radahn ; this will allow you to open up new dialogue options with sellen. if you already beat radahn at this point, simply reloading the area will open up her new dialogue option; however, if you have yet to do that, take care of it now and then return to sellen in the waypoint ruins. sellen will now ask yet another favor of you, and will explain that the form you see before her is not her true body. she tells you to go search for her body on the weeping peninsula; finding sellen at this new location is required to progress her quest, so leave here and make your way to the witchbane ruins . make your way over to the witchbane ruins on the weeping peninsula, on the western side just south of the fourth church of marika, to find sorceress sellen shackled in the dungeon. when you reach the ruins, speak to sellen and she'll give you her primal glintstone to safekeep. from here, you must findthe location of her third form, which requires progression of ranni's questline , as you will need to access seluvis's secret chamber for the next leg of sellen's quest. to continue sellen's quest, you must find seluvis's secret chamber, which you may have discovered as part of the seluvis questline. that's located east of ranni's rise. if you have not yet done so, the seluvis's questline page of this guide gives the specific location of the hidden chamber, northeast of ranni's rise and obscured by an illusory floor. enter the chamber and roll against the far wall to reveal an illusory wall, behind which you will find sellen imprisoned. here, you will be given the option to "transplant the primal glintstone ." doing so will allow this iteration of sellen to reanimate, finally granting her freedom of movement. she will note that she is planning to return to the academy of raya lucaria . if you return to the waypoint ruins now, sellen will no longer be there. for the final step of sellen's journey, you will need to travel back to redmane castle and speak to castellan jerren , who will note that with radahn defeated, he is no longer bound to stay at the castle. you can now find him in witchbane ruins, overlooking the body of sellen, now surrounded by blood. he tells you that she was known as the graven witch, obsessed with restoring the primeval current, and that she was the most dangerous mage known to the academy of raya lucaria . exhaust jerren's dialogue and fast travel to raya lucaria to come to the end of sellen's questline. note that if you cannot find him at redmane castle or witchbane ruins, he has likely already moved on to raya lucaria. if sellen's body is surrounded by blood, you'll know to find him at the final location. go to the raya lucaria grand library and by the entrance, you'll see two summoning stones. a red one allows you to be summoned to challenge sorceress sellen, while the gold one allows you to be summoned to assist her. if you challenge sellen in the fight, you'll be siding with castellan jerren . defeating sellen will give you the witch's glintstone crown and sellen's bell bearing . jerren will also reward you with an ancient dragon smithing stone . however, because of your betrayal, you will be unable to grab lusat's or azur's armor sets from where their bodies are located. if you choose to be summoned to assist sorceress sellen, you'll fight with her against witch-hunter jerren in the grand library. defeating him rewards you with: eccentric's hood eccentric's armor eccentric's manchettes eccentric's breeches return to your world to find sellen standing in rennala's spot in the grand library of raya lucaria. speaking to her here will grant you the sellen glintstone kris , as well as add the shard spiral sorcery to sellen's purchase inventory. head back to mt. gelmir and sellia to retrieve lusat's and azur's respective armor sets from where their bodies once were. lusat's glintstone crown lusat's robe lusat's manchettes azur's glintstone crown azur's glintstone robe old sorcerer's legwraps finally, return to the grand library of raya lucaria to find that sellen has moved to the far side of the room and transformed into a school of graven mages. sitting next to her, you will find her witch's glintstone crown . note that despite her new form, she is still available as a merchant that can sell you sorceries. /n white-faced varre is one of the many npcs you'll encounter that has a side quest to complete in elden ring. for this part of our elden ring guide , you'll find details of where to find this npc, how to begin their questline and the outcomes of your choices. white-faced varre is one of the very first npcs you'll encounter when you begin your journey across the lands between in elden ring. at the first step site of grace , white-faced varre will be there in his white mask, telling you to head to stormveil castle . when you reach liurnia of the lakes, if you travel back to the first step site of grace , white-faced varre will have disappeared and a figure of him will be there instead. you'll now be able to find him at the rose church in liurnia of the lakes, due west of the fallen ruins of the lake site of grace . speak to him and he'll ask you what you think of the two fingers . you can either say that you trust them or that you are unsure about them. if you say you trust them, the conversation will end here. you can speak to him again and change your mind, however, saying you're unsure about them. this will progress white-faced varre's questline. he will gift you with 5 bloody festing fingers and tell you to use them. you'll need to use them three times before you can return to varre, and he'll have more to say. to progress varre's questline, you will need to perform at least three invasions. you can do this by either opting to play online and use a bloody festering finger to invade other players (note that you do not have to defeat them; if you're having a rough go of it, simply invading and then jumping off a cliff counts towards your goal). as of patch 1.06, you also now have the option to invade an npc called magnus the beast claw , whose sign may be found at the writheblood ruins , just north of the mirage rise on the altus plateau. if you choose the npc route, you only need to defeat this one to progress the quest (versus three player characters). return to varre and speak to him. during the conversation, he'll give you two options: to be anointed or to refuse. if you choose to be anointed, he'll present you with the lord of blood's favor . your final trial for him will be to soak the cloth with a maiden's blood. if you refuse, you will have the option again to choose anointment, as it is the only way to progress his quest. varre will say that normally, you are supposed to kill your own maiden and recount the wisdom of the two fingers, but as you have no maiden, any maiden will do. at this point, there are several ways to acquire maiden's blood . which of these is more convenient to access is dependent on which parts of the map you have unlocked, as well as how far along you've progressed certain npc's questlines. you can acquire maiden blood by going back to the chapel of anticipation, the place where you began your journey in elden ring. to get here, you'll need to use one of the teleporters at the four belfries . the third imp statue seal unlocks the teleporter to the chapel of anticipation. you'll need an imbued sword key , which you can find the location of on our stonesword keys locations page. kill the grafted scion here and you'll unlock all of the chapel of anticipation. you'll want to head over to the rope bridge to the chapel, and you'll find the maiden here that you will have encountered when you began the game. approach her and select the option to soak the cloth in her blood. if you have not yet progressed irina's questline , head to the weeping peninsula, just past the bridge of sacrifice, to find her seated near the road. kill her to reveal the option to soak the cloth in her blood. note that doing this will lock you out of completing edgar's quest , although he will still invade you regardless at the revenger's shack. your third option for maiden's blood is at the church of inhibition in northern liurnia. head just north of the frenzied flame village and defeat the invading npc named festering finger vyke . head into the church, activate the site of grace, then look just to the left of it to see the dead maiden. once you have collected maiden's blood using one of these methods, return to varre at the rose church. during the conversation, you'll be asked to offer your finger. doing so gives you the bloody finger item. speak to him again and you'll receive a pureblood knight's medal . this gives you to power to give you an audience with luminary mohg. at this point, you can choose to go to mohgwyn's palace using the pureblood knight's medal . make your way through these ruins until you reach the mausoleum dynasty midpoint site of grace . activate it and rest at it to reveal a red summon sign on the ground. choosing to activate this will allow varre to invade your world. as this is the only way to end his quest, take him on in battle. upon defeating him, reload the area and return to the location of the invasion sign to find him wounded on the ground. speak to him here and exhaust his dialogue until he expires, at which point he will drop the festering bloody fingers and varre's bouquet items to put an end to his quest. /n irina is one of the many npcs you'll encounter that has a side quest to complete in elden ring. for this part of our elden ring guide, you'll find details of where to find this npc, how to begin their questline, and the various ways the quest may resolve. head to the weeping peninsula at the southernmost tip of limgrave. after crossing the bridge of sacrifice, activate the site of grace to the right of the path, then continue south on the path until you see her sitting near a low wall to your left. when you speak to her, she'll explain that her compatriots were attacked and killed, and will ask you to deliver a letter to her father at castle morne to let him know that she's alive. this links to the edgar questline . when you reach castle morne, proceed through the courtyard, past the pumpkin head, and up the ladder. fight your way past the terrestrial and flying misbegotten that guard the wooden bridge overlooking the courtyard. cross the bridge, and instead of dropping down to the site of grace, you’ll want to go northeast toward the soldiers and misbegotten that are locked in battle. while you're able to run past these enemies as they are occupied with killing each other, we recommend stopping en route to slay them. this ensures none of them follow you to edgar's location, potentially slaying him and inadvertently ending irina's and edgar's questlines prematurely. from here, continue northeast, then climb the stairs and round the corner to find irina's father, edgar. upon delivering the letter to edgar, he will express gratitude that irina is a live and well; however, this is not enough to advance the quest. he will note that he is duty-sworn to continue to protect this castle, which is the game's way of telling you that you need to beat the boss in this area before you can continue. head to the very bottom of the castle, onto the sandy shores dotted with jellyfish, and across to the golden fog that indicates the entrance to a boss arena. enter and defeat the leonine misbegotten. from here, you can return to edgar and let him know that the job is done, which will unlock new dialogue and will get him to move to his next location. make your way back to where you first found irina to access the final leg of her questline. upon returning to irina, you will find edgar kneeling over her corpse, wherein he will swear revenge upon whomever did this to his daughter. thus marks the end of irina's questline. however, this is not the last you may see of edgar... /n edgar is one of the many npcs you'll encounter that has a side quest to complete in elden ring. for this part of our elden ring guide, you'll find details of where to find him, how to begin his questline, and the outcomes of the choices you make along the way. when you reach castle morne (located on the southernmost point of the weeping peninsula in limgrave) proceed through the courtyard, past the pumpkin head, and up the ladder to your right. fight your way past the terrestrial and flying misbegotten that guard the wooden bridge overlooking the courtyard. cross the bridge then head northeast toward the soldiers and misbegotten that are locked in battle. upon defeating them (we recommend not just running past, as they may follow you and inadvertently kill edger) continue northeast along these ramparts until you hit a stairway wrapping around the side of a crenelated tower. head up these and continue forward on this tower to find edgar sitting against the far wall. speak to him here to give him irina's letter to help reassure him that she's still alive and well. while edgar will express his relief that irina is okay, he will not abandon his duty as the warden of castle morne. to progress his quest, you must defeat the area boss. make your way to the very bottom of castle morne, to the sandy beaches populated by jellyfish. head through the boss fog door here to defeat the leonine misbegotten in this area. return to edgar and let him know that you've killed it; this will allow him to finally leave the castle and go to his daughter. return to where you first found irina to meet edgar in his new location. you will find him bent over her corpse, expressing guilt that he chose duty over protecting her, and swearing revenge on whomever killed her. you cannot interact with him further at this point, so continue onward in your adventure. continue through the game until you eventually reach the revenger's shack in southwest liurnia, just north of the minor erdtree. the ground around this area is dotted with the corpses of dead misbegotten, foreshadowing the wanton violence of a man seeking revenge. upon approaching the site of grace , you will get a notification that you are being invaded by a hostile npc named edgar the revenger . defeating him will get you a banished knight's halberd +8 and a shibriri grape . note that the latter can be used for hyetta 's questline. note that edgar the revenger will invade you here regardless of whether or not you engaged in edgar or irina's questline prior to arriving at this location. /n albus is one of the many npcs you'll encounter that has a side quest to complete in elden ring. for this part of our elden ring guide, you'll find details of where to find him, how to begin his questline, and the outcomes of your choices along the way. to first locate albus, heard to the village of the albinaurics on the southwest shore of liurnia of the lakes. you'll be able to identify the entrance as the water becomes a poisoning swamp, and there will be a sharp increase in giant crab enemies. progress through the village, until you hit the village of the albinaurics site of grace. instead of crossing the bridge to the north, double back, and continue upward, past the crazed perfumer, until you hit a grave next to a large pot. roll into or attack the pot to reveal that it is albus. upon speaking to albus, he'll grant you one half of the haligtree secret medallion (right) . he then instructs you to find latenna, the albinauric woman, and give her the medallion. prior to hunting down latenna, return to the roundtable hold for a surprise. here, however, albus' part in this quest officially ends. if you exhausted his dialogue in this meeting, he will keel over dead in front of you and his body will dematerialize; otherwise, reloading the area will result in his disappearance and presumed death. /n hyetta is one of the many npcs you'll encounter that has a side quest to complete in elden ring. for this part of our elden ring guide, you'll find details of where to find her, how to begin her questline, and the consequences of your actions along the way. to first make hyetta appear you must speak to irina (see the irina's questline part of this guide) and, at minimum, receive the key item irina's letter . you can choose to complete or abandon irina's quest at this point, as hyetta will now spawn regardless. head to the lake-facing cliffs site of grace near the church of irith in liurnia. rest here to get hyetta to spawn, and speak to her to get her to introduce herself. at this point, the only way to progress her quest is to give her a shabriri grape . while there are several of these key items scattered throughout the world, the easiest one to get at this point is on a ghostly figure located just after the godrick the grafted boss room. from the ladder down from the throne room, turn around to face the northeast to find the shabriri grape in question. once you have secured this, speak to hyetta here and offer her the grape; exhaust her dialogue here after she's consumed it to get her to move to her second location. continue through this area until you reach the purified ruins , located just south of the liurnia highway north site of grace in east liurnia, where you will encounter her again. at this point, you must give her another shabriri grape . luckily, one is located nearby. head into the main part of the ruins and look at the ground to see some horizontal boards; roll across these to break them and reveal an underground cellar. enter this room to receive the two fingers heirloom and the shabriri grape. from here, head due west until you reach the part of the ruins that is closest to the lakefront. hyetta will be standing here, awaiting another grape. give it to her and exhaust her dialogue to get her to move to her third location. continue northward along the eastern shore of liurnia until you reach the gate town bridge site of grace ; look due north from this site of grace to find her standing against the cliffside. at this point, she will request another grape. the easiest one to retrieve at this point is at the revenger's shack in southwest liurnia, just north of the minor erdtree. head here and defeat edgar, the revenger to receive another shabriri grape . return and speak to her. there are two options to choose when hyetta asks what the grapes are. you can either say "they're human eyes" or "don't say anything." if you tell her, she'll be upset but says to think no more of it. rest at the nearby site of grace , then speak to her again. she'll let you know she's come to the conclusion that she's destined to be a finger maiden . at this point, she will again move on to her next location. continue northward again until you reach the bellum church to see hyetta once again. this time she'll ask you to bring her a fingerprint grape . to obtain this, head to the church of inhibition where you'll be invaded by festering fingerprint vyke . to reach the church of inhibition, go to the grand lift of dectus site of grace . travel up to the path that takes you to the frenzied flame village and carry on upwards, towards the ruins of the church. once here, you should be invaded by festering fingerprint vyke and when you kill him, you'll receive a fingerprint grape . return to bellum church to give this to hyetta. note that while you have the option to not hand it over, ultimately doing so is the only way to progress her questline. after defeating mohg, the omen , hit the altar at the end of his boss room to reveal an illusory wall. follow this path downward, dropping from beam to beam, until you hit the ground. at this point, the floor will give way and you will be plunged further downward, into the frenzied flame proscription . hyetta will be waiting for you here, and will hint at what you must do to complete her quest (as well as unlock a potential ending to the game). head to the door before you and remove your clothing to reveal the three fingers behind the burning door. after you see the three fingers, return to speak to hyetta where she will offer to become your finger maiden. she will request that you touch her. unfortunately, while you need to do that to finish her questline, the act of touching her causes her to begin to burn. she will eventually die in agony. at this point, you can loot her corpse to get the frenzied flame seal and frenzyflame stones . /n latenna is one of the many npcs you'll encounter that has a side quest to complete in elden ring. for this part of our elden ring guide, you'll find details of where to find her, how to begin her questline, and the outcomes of any choices you make along the way. latenna can first be found at the slumbering wolf's shack in the southern part of liurnia of the lakes. to reach the slumbering wolf's shack, you must pass through the lakeside crystal cave. upon defeating the bloodhound knight dungeon boss, a passage will open up that will take you further through the mountainside. eventually, you'll come out to a remote clearing where you will find an albinauric woman leaning against the body of a large white wolf. this is latenna. latenna's quest can only begin once you’ve spoken with albus (see albus questline ). when you uncover albus in village of the albinaurics, he'll give you one half of the haligtree secret medallion (right) and tell you to seek out latenna. if you attempt to speak to latenna without the medallion half, she will be mistrustful of you and will not answer your questions. upon showing her the medallion half, she’ll note that this must mean albus trusts you; she then explains to you that she can show you where the other half is, but only if you promise to take her to miquella’s haligtree . once you agree to her terms, she will transform into a summonable spirit ash . outside of summoning her as a spirit ash (although this is entirely up to your discretion–whether or not you choose to do so will not impact her quest), you will not encounter the next part of her quest until you reach the mountaintop of the giants . head north of the erdtree in this area; as you travel, latenna will begin speaking to you unprompted and will let you know that you are nearing castle sol, which is where you will find the second half of the haligtree secret medallion (left). more information on how to navigate this area can be found on our castle sol location and walkthrough page of this wiki. to access the final location of latenna’s questline, you will need to head to the grand lift of rold. upon approaching it and interacting with it, you will need to scroll through your interactable options so that it says “hoist secret medallion” instead of “hoist medallion.” upon doing so, you will gain access to the consecrated snowfields and miquella’s haligtree. make your way to the furthermost northeastern corner of this area, where you will find a structure called the apostate derelict. upon approaching the large albinauric woman’s body on the throne, you will be given the option to summon latenna. doing so will cause her to appear and speak to you. exhausting her dialogue will grant you a somber ancient dragon smithing stone ./n ranni the witch is one of the many elden ring npcs you'll encounter that has a main quest that results in a unique ending to the game. in this walkthrough for ranni's questline, you'll learn where to find her, whether to serve ranni, and the outcomes of the various choices you may make along the way. this questline is also a great way to collect more larval tears, as it will take you to two areas that are full of them. watch the video below or jump to a section in this complete guide to ranni's questline in elden ring. where to find ranni the witch redmane castle nokron, eternal city return to ranni's rise nokstella, eternal city to speak to ranni, you'll have to complete caria manor in northern liurnia . upon defeating royal knight loretta , you will gain access to the three sisters area containing three distinct towers. head towards the westernmost one to reveal that it is called ranni's rise. here is where you'll find her. note: this is not the first time you speak to ranni, however. tap to reveal when you reach ranni's rise, head all the way up to the top to begin your conversation with ranni. continue through her dialogue options until she offers you the chance to serve her. ranni will ask you to serve her once you reach her. there are no negative consequences to saying yes - only boons, such as more story questlines and unique rewards. you must complete ranni's questline to continue fia's questline , which unlocks yet another unique ending as well. upon accepting, she will task you with finding the lost treasure of nokron. this will involve you in the sidequests of several other npc's, most notably the following: alexander the iron fist questline blaidd questline seluvis questline after you've exhausted the conversation with ranni, she'll ask you to speak to three people in her service: blaidd, iji and seluvis. to speak to them, simply make your way back down ranni's rise and you'll encounter apparitions of all three along the way. once you've exhausted each npc's dialogue, blaidd will tell you that you can next see him in siofra river and that the seluvis's rise will be unlocked, which allows you to begin the seluvis questline . head to siofra river and find blaidd just north of the hallowhorn grounds site of grace . exhaust the dialogue options with him and he'll tell you that he thinks seluvis knows more about accessing nokron than he's pretending. head back to seluvis's rise to speak with him seluvis will tell you that sorceress sellen may have some information, and will give you seluvis's introduction to take to sellen and learn more. sellen will tell you that starscourge radahn is the key to unlocking nokron, but as he holds the stars, you'll need to defeat him to gain access to it. if you've been looking for the festival that alexander the iron fist mentioned in his questline, the conversation with seluvis is the only way to trigger it. once you learn this information about radahn, you'll be able to return to blaidd. he says he'll meet you at redmane castle to fight alongside you against radahn, so this is where you should head next. when you reach the courtyard, you'll see numerous npcs gathered including blaidd and alexander the iron fist. head up the stairs, and there is an announcer who you can speak to and initiate the festival. he'll ask you if you're ready and give you a backstory to radahn. the doors to enter radahn's boss battle won't open unless you speak to him. proceed through the doors up the stairs, taking the one directly behind the chair, then going to the right to take a lift down to a teleporter that will take you over to the boss battle with radahn. here you'll be able to summon a number of npcs to help in the fight against him. want to know how to beat radahn? take a look at our elden ring boss guide for starscourge radahn to get hints and tips on how to approach the fight. when you've beaten radahn, talk to blaidd. he'll tell you that you should meet "where the falling star bit the earth". defeating radahn not only progresses ranni the witch's questline, but also: the blaidd questline the sorceress sellen questline blaidd is difficult to find at this point, but if you go past the folorn hound evergaol, you'll hear a familiar howling sound. when you approach the evergaol, you'll have to option to talk. blaidd will tell you that iji has trapped blaidd in the evergaol, and you'll have the option to either open it or not. if you open it, blaidd will be released and you'll be free to talk to him. he tells you he'll be on his way to ranni to check that she's safe. if you go to ranni's rise, there'll be no sign of blaidd though. you will now have access to nokron, which you can enter via a crater south of the mistwood ruins . you'll see a rock formation floating in the centre. drop down onto the ledges, making your way round to the doorway on the left. continue following this path and you'll reach nokron, eternal city with rooftops you'll need to make your way across. carefully make your way across the rooftops in a generally northeast direction, until you reach a ledge on the left side that you can walk across. enter the open window to the northwest here. make your way northeast from here, dropping down onto the ledge below. carry on in this direction to find a site of grace. head northeast from here, and take the stairs leading down on the right. follow the path from here, and you'll soon reach a veiled door. step inside and there will be a mimic tear for you to fight. once you've beaten the mimic tear, the path to the northeast will open up and a site of grace will appear. run along the bridge and take the left, when the bridge slopes. continue hugging this path to the left, then take the first opening to find another site of grace. from here, jump onto the rooftops to the southwest. then jump down to the smaller ledge below this, to the southwest. go round the corner, to the northwest, and follow it around until you can jump over to the right where the corpse is hanging off the edge of the ledge. go forward and jump across the circular roof and down to where the two black blobs are. when you jump down, these will turn into two silver tear enemies. after defeating these, take the path to the left and drop down from the gap onto the ledge. go forward then drop down onto the bridge that leads to two open windows. drop down and make your way to the lowest level in this area, with the giant stone ball in the middle. it will roll after you, but if you defeat the stone ball, it will drop a larval tear. take the door, and turn to the right. there will be another site of grace here on the left for you to use. now take the path all the way to the north and into the building. there's a chest here that has the fingerslayer blade that ranni is looking for. go back to ranni's rise and let her know you have the fingerslayer blade. speak to her and make sure you exhaust her dialogue options to receive the carian inverted statue . renna's rise will now be unlocked. you can find this to the northeast of ranni's rise. climb up the ladder and open the chest in the southeast to receive: snow witch hat snow witch robe snow witch skirt climb the tower and you'll find a teleporter. this will take you to ansel river main. approach the open stone blocks and you'll be able to pick up a miniature ranni doll. head up to the site of grace, then rest at it. this will give you the option to talk to the miniature ranni doll. be sure to try and speak to it a few times to unlock the dialogue. she'll then ask you to eliminate the baleful shadows roaming nearby. head up to the uld palace ruins and go into the river past the stairs. then take the first turning on the right, where a door will now be open. this will lead you to nokstella, eternal city. when you've reached the nokstella site of grace in nokstella, eternal city , don’t take the stairs, but instead follow the path along the floor. when you reach a building in the south, this has a lift for you to take down. take the lift and find the nokstella waterfall basin site of grace. if you rest here, you can talk to ranni some more. head forward towards the eggs, and follow the path around to the red room. you’ll be invaded by a baleful shadow here that bears a striking resemblance to blaidd (though it is not him). fight the shadow, and ranni will thank you, saying farewell and giving you the discarded palace key. (this can be used to open rennalla’s locked chest in the grand library, where you’ll receive a dark moon ring). head southeast into the building and take the lift further down to the lake of rot . make your way across the lake of rot to the grand cloister . you can run to various platforms around the lake of rot, pressing the buttons on the floor to raise structures and make your crossing easier. when you reach the grand cloister, run down this path, dropping down from the ledge onto ledges below. do this until you safely reach the bottom. take the path up and to the left, until you reach a coffin. press rest at coffin and a cutscene will begin, tipping you over the edge of the waterfall. down below, you’ll see a veiled door and have to fight astel, naturalborn of the void. after defeating this boss, you'll find a sealed gate at the other end of the boss arena - which can only be opened by one who has the dark moon ring from the locked chest in the raya lucaria grand library. opening this seal will reveal an elevator taking you out of the ainsel river well and up onto the moonlight altar - the large mountaintop above liurnia on its far west side. this area is incredibly high level, and features multiple dragons - as well as the return of glintstone dragon adula who is much tougher than when fought back at the three sisters. fight or bypass the dragon and enter the large cathedral, and you'll find a hole in the ground you can drop into. here, you will find that ranni has completed her deed, taking back her destiny and eliminating her adversary. interact with ranni, and you'll place the dark moon ring on her finger, swearing your allegiance as her consort. at this point, ranni will bid you to continue your journey to become and elden lord, and when the time comes, the two of you will rule together. after she disappears, return to the hole to find her final parting gift - the darkmoon greatsword weapon. /n rya is one of the many npcs you'll encounter that has a side quest to complete in elden ring. for this part of our elden ring guide, you'll find details of where to find this npc, how to begin their questline and the outcomes of your choices, as well as what to do with the tonic of forgetfulness. rya can be found northwest of laskyar ruins , just by the telescope icon on the map. she'll be standing on the right-hand side of the statue. when you talk to her, she'll tell you that a thief has stolen her necklace and ask you to get it back. for this, you'll need to continue heading northwest from the telescope icon and find boilprawn shack. speak to the blackguard by the pot and you'll have two options to either leave or ask him to give you the necklace. choose "give me the necklace" and he'll ask you to show him what it's worth and pay for it. you can accept or refuse. if you refuse, the conversation ends. if you accept, he'll want you to pay 1000 runes for the necklace. buy the necklace back and you can talk to him some more about rya, you can also purchase boiled prawn from him, which boosts physical damage negation. go back to rya and give her the necklace. in return, she'll give you a volcano manor invitation. she will also tell you to reach the altus plateau and that you'll be welcome at volcano manor . continue the dialogue and she'll let you know about the dectus lift that will get you to the altus plateau, as well as a shortcut by the ruins that links liurnia to the altus plateau. once you've hoisted the medallion to operate the grand lift of dectus , you'll have access to the altus plateau. as you exit, you'll see rya on the left-hand side. here she'll invite you to volcano manor . she'll teleport you there if you take her hand. if you reach volcano manor before seeing rya and returning the necklace, you'll see her there again anyway. she'll disappear as you make your way through the assassinations as part of the tanith questline . it seems that if you do not find rya again before completing the tanith questline you are unable to progress her questline, so be sure to continue her quest before finishing up with the volcano manor assassinations. rya will tell you that she hears strange sounds behind the walls sometimes. rya will move after this and you can now find her in the room opposite the drawing room (the second door on the right). rya will have taken her true form here, that of a serpent. she will tell you that only she and tanith know her true form and her real name, zoraya. you can speak to tanith and she'll ask you to be kind to rya. once you've defeated the godskin noble at the temple of eiglay, you can pick up a serpent's amnion . return to rya and speak to her again, she will be back to her human-like form here. after you've completed the second assassination for volcano manor , you can speak to rya again. you'll have the option here to tell her the truth about volcano manor and give her the serpent's amnion. go to tanith and speak to her about rya/zoraya's troubles. rest at the site of grace then speak to tanith again about rya/zoraya's absence. she will give you a ' tonic of forgetfulness 'and ask you to give this to rya. to find rya next, you'll need to go to the temple of eiglay. take the lift up to the top floor, then walk out onto the balcony. look to the right as you make your way around the balcony, to find a ledge you can jump down on. this is a path you can take up to another section of the manor. follow this up and be careful of the abductor virgin that will come round the corner. in the distance, you should spot an archway that's across a lava river (to the right of it, there are snake head statues sticking out). head over here, and there will be a small room off to the right, where rya is hiding. speak to her and she'll ask you to kill her. you can either do this, give her the potion or don't give her the potion. no matter what option you choose, you'll receive daedicar's woe . interestingly enough, if you keep the tonic of forgetfulness, you can trigger an option to give the tonic to brother corhyn upon meeting him and goldmask in the mountaintops of the giants, but he will refuse it. /n seluvis is one of the many npcs you'll encounter that has a side quest to complete in elden ring. for this part of our elden ring guide, you'll find details of where to find him, how to begin his questline, and the consequences of any choices you make along the way. upon accessing the three sisters i n northwest liurnia, you'll be granted access to three distinct towers; however, to remove the magic barrier in front of seluvis's tower, you will need to visit ranni's rise and begin the ranni the witch questline . by doing this, you can speak to seluvis in his own tower. seluvis is able to teach your sorcery, but he won't do so until you complete a quest for him (and he'll refuse to talk to you until you tell him it's complete). he asks you to take a potion and deliver it to nepheli loux, linking seluvis's questline to the nepheli loux questline . you'll need to get nepheli loux to return to the roundtable hold from her spot near the village of the albinaurics . note that speaking to her at any other location will not allow you to progress seluvis's questline by giving her the potion. nepheli can be found down the stairs near master hewg, and will be upset to the point of unresponsiveness. to progress this quest, you must instead go upstairs and speak to gideon. you then have the option of giving it to him (to dispose of) or instead giving it to nepheli . if you choose for him to dispose of it, he'll tell you to nevertheless tell seluvis that you gave nepheli the potion. return to seluvis and tell him that you gave nepheli the potion. whether or not you chose to give it to her, or if you're simply lying to him, his quest will progress regardless. exhaust his dialogue here to unlock the ability to buy sorceries from him. seluvis's questline links to a few different quests for other npcs. not only does his quest overlap with the nepheli loux questline and the ranni the witch questline but there's also a link to the sorceress sellen questline . there is a hidden chamber in the ruins by ranni's rise that reveals seluvis's monstrous secret. the ruins themselves can be somewhat difficult to find; the map below pinpoints the exact location. roll on the ground near the invisible noble sorcerer here to reveal an illusory floor, leading down into a subterannean chamber. here, you will find a number of individuals who appear to be frozen, possibly dead. against the far wall, you'll see a message on the floor noting that these individuals are selvius's puppets. just to the left of this wall, is another illusory wall. hit this one and you'll reveal what seems to be a motionless sorceress sellen and a replica of her room in the waypoint ruins. go back and speak to seluvis again and tell him you've seen the chamber. because he thinks you've given the potion to nepheli, he'll claim you're working together and gives you the option to choose between two special summonable ashes - finger maiden therolina puppet or jarwright puppet . if you actually gave the potion to nepheli, there will be a third option to choose from - dolores the sleeping arrow puppet . whichever option you pick, you'll be able to buy the others using starlight shards as currency. once you've bought another sorcery from him, you will see the dialogue option to ask seluvis about his plot. he explains that he seeks to make a puppet out of a demigod - and, in the process, betray ranni. seeking your help, he'll ask for you to find him amber starlight , a powerful item that can be used to make a potion to sway even the gods. head to the altus plateau, to the northeast of the altus highway junction site of grace . search for the small passage leading under a larger plateau, following it along until you find a hidden shrine with a statue of a woman and child. here you'll find the amber starlight that can be given to seluvis. return to him and give him this key item to allow him to make his amber draught . at this point, he will reward you with a magic scorpion charm . he'll then ask you to be the one to give the amber draught to ranni. once you have given ranni the fingerslayer blade from nokron, eternal city , she will disappear from her tower, opening up a portal to nokstella, eternal city in the tower called renna's rise. before she goes, however, she notes that she is aware of seluvis's plot, and that she intends to do something about it. if you return to seluvis once ranni has departed, you'll find him dead, although choosing to examine him will reveal that he is still available as a vendor of puppets. note that if you locked yourself out of getting nepheli's or dolore's puppet spirit ashes , you are still able to do so from the body of the npc pidia , located within caria manor . /n thops is one of the many npcs you'll encounter that has a side quest to complete in elden ring. for this part of our elden ring guide, you'll find details of where to find him, how to begin his questline, and the outcomes of your choices. you'll first find thops at the church of irith in liurnia of the lakes, at the southernmost point of the lake. talking to him here (including donating 10 ruins to unlock him as a sorceries vendor) will reveal that he wants to return to the academy of raya lucaria , but to do so, he needs an academy glintstone key . once you've received your own academy glintstone key from behind glintstone dragon smarag , make your way through the academy until you get to the fight with the red wolf of radagon in the academy's debate parlor . upon beating him, head through the door to the north, continuing on until you reach a large courtyard. keep left, until you see a pile of rubble covering a stairway. head up the rubble, then continue north up the stairs leading to two glintstone sorcerers . instead of continuing forward through the covered walkway, hang a left. jump to the stairs below. continue along the stairs and turn left (towards the south) to see a body slumped over the railing. the left side of the courtyard. go up to the northwest, where there's rubble instead of stairs. go up here, then up the stairs and around to the left. you'll find a body hanging over the ledge. once you've gotten onto the rooftops, follow them south, past two marionette soldiers , until you see a ladder up to the roof of a building to your right. climb up this ladder to find a long, narrow rooftop. proceed with caution, as there are three avionette soldiers lying in ambush, as well as another glintstone sorcerer . upon defeating these enemies, continue along the rooftop and then hang a right. look down to see another rooftop to traverse. continue north, jumping to the rooftops below until you run out of northward options. turn to the left (west) to see another set of descending rooftops, then look to your right to see another marionette soldier standing watch on the roof below. upon killing him look down and to your left (northwest) to see a ledge below you. descend carefully and follow it around the building until it reveals even more rooftops below you, being patrolled by several more marionette soldiers . hop down to the oval-shaped rooftop below you, take out the enemies here, then progress around it in either to reach the open windows, leading into the rafters of the debate parlor . enter into whichever window you see fit, and look down to see a chandelier upon which rests a body and an item. this is the academy glintstone key you'll need for thops . carefully platform your way down, grab it, and then make your way back to thops at the church of irith . returning to thops and giving him the academy glintstone key will reward you with the erudition gesture; it will unlock the next and final leg of his questline. return to raya lucaria, and make your way to the schoolhouse classroom (the easiest way to do this is by warping to that site of grace). leave the room through the door to the west, then hang a right around the side of the building to find thops. loot his corpse to receive thopps' bell bearing and an academy glintstone staff . thus concludes thops' questline. /n gowry is one of the many npcs you'll encounter that has a side quest to complete in elden ring. for this part of our elden ring guide, you'll find details of where to find him, how to begin his questline and the consequences of any actions you may take that will impact his story. you can find gowry in his shack, located between the sellia gateway and sellia, town of sorcery in caelid . the closest site of grace is sellia under-stair or sellia backstreets (only accessible after completing the puzzle outlined below), although note that you'll need to make your way through sellia to access him in both cases. you will also see two white signs on the ground to the north and the south of sellia directing you to his shack. speaking to him will reveal that he is looking for a tarnished to aid him in a task, the payment for which will be his teaching you the secrets of sellia. upon confirming that you're willing to help, he tells you of millicent, who is being held captive in the church of the plague on the cliff overlooking sellia. however, before you can rescue her, you need to retrieve the unalloyed gold needle key item. the unalloyed gold needle can only be retrieved upon the defeat of the optional field boss commander o'neil. to find this fight, head west of sellia into the swamps of aeonia. head towards the base of the large remains of an erdtree to find a patch of ground in the center where o'neil will be waiting. head back to gowry's shack to give him the needle and receive the sellia secrets item. he'll also note that he'll need time to repair the needle, so plan to return to him later. the note for sellia's secrets says: "the town of sellia hides the source. light three flames atop the candle towers to break the seal." to solve this puzzle, you must head back into sellia and investigate the three tall towers scattered through the town. climb these and light each flame at the top to break the magic seals scattered throughout the town, as well as the ones blocking your path upward to millicent. to reach two of these, you will need to jump from a branch growing out of the nearby staircase, and then platform across the rooftops to access the ladders up the towers. the final one may be accessed by dropping down onto a branch from near the golden sapling, under which you will find a golden seed , located at the top of the stairs at the north end of sellia. before climbing upward, return to gowry to retrieve the unalloyed golden needle. if it is not yet ready, rest at a site of grace to reload the area. from there, ascend to the church of plague, accessible through the large archway on the far north side of sellia. note that you will need to venture high above the city, along a pathway full of switchbacks traps. eventually, you will see a small church guarded by two kindred of rot. to be safe, we recommend killing them to ensure they do not inadvertently kill millicent. give millicent the unalloyed gold needle , wherein she will use it and then become unresponsive. at this point, you are free to return to gowry to let him know that you've completed this leg of his request. at this point, you are now able to learn sorceries from him. here is where his quest functionally ends, although we recommend returning to him between each stage of millicent's questline , as he offers insight into her backstory. /n millicent is one of the many npcs you'll encounter that has a side quest to complete in elden ring. for this part of our elden ring guide, you'll find details of where to find her, how to begin and progress her questline, and the outcomes of any major choices you make along the way. to find millicent, you must first speak with gowry , who can be found at gowry's shack located between the sellia gateway and sellia, town of sorcery in caelid . he will ask you to attend to a sick girl who is being held captive in the church of the plague , located on the cliff just above his shack. however, to do so, you must first retrieve the unalloyed gold needle from commander o'neil and then again speak to gowry to receive the key to solving the puzzle of sellia to unlock the gateway leading up to the church of the plague. before heading up the path to rescue millicent, return to gowry to receive the unalloyed golden needle, now repaired. he will direct you to travel the path upward to the church of the plague to give the needle to millicent. follow the road upward until you reach a graveyard, beyond which you will see a church guarded by two kindred of rot . we recommend defeating these enemies, as they may otherwise follow you into the church and inadvertently kill millicent while you're speaking with her. upon arrival, light the site of grace located here and look to the front of the church to see millicent collapsed against the wall. give her the unalloyed gold needle , at which point she will take it and become unresponsive. reload the area to find her now standing in that same spot. when you speak to her, she'll say that she needs to go on a journey, which upon reloading the area, will reveal that she has moved to her next location. at this point, she will also give you the prosthesis-wearing heirloom talisman by way of thanks. return to gowry's shack to find her there (however, gowry will be missing at this point). she said that she decided to pay it a visit as it felt familiar to her. after this, she'll say she needs to focus on her journey and leave gowry's shack. you will next encounter millicent near the erdtree-gazing hill site of grace on the northeastern side of the altus plateau. head north from the site of grace to find her standing near the rocks by the cliff edge. speaking to her here will reveal that she's tracing the path that malenia took, and hints that malenia may be found to the far north of the lands between. exhaust her dialogue here, but note that she will not move to her third location yet until you have given her a key item, detailed below. to continue her quest, you must first swing by the shaded castle located in a cove on the northern shore of the altus plateau. here you will find the valkyrie's prosthesis key item. you can find this west of the shaded castle inner gate site of grace ; however, note that while this is the closest site of grace, the location of the prosthesis is actually inaccessible from here. instead, go to the northeast of the outskirts of the castle and hop onto the ledge with the broken wall. go right, then platform over to the roof using the broken part of the wall to the left. run across the rooftops, heading southeast towards the ladder on the left. climb up and follow this around to the left, all the way to the end of the rampart, until you reach the room with a cleanrot knight outside and statues inside. open the chest in here to receive the valkyrie's prosthesis . return to millicent and give her the prosthesis. she thanks you and says that she may now be able to help you in battle in the future. reload the area to reveal that she has finally moved to her third location. once you've given millicent the prosthesis, the next time she'll appear is at domniula, windmill village after you defeat the godskin noble . this village can be found to the northeast of the shaded castle, and is easily identifiable by the windmills on the map. all you need to do at this location is once again exhaust her dialogue, wherein she will restate her still with a sword and offer to aid you in battle. the next time you'll see millicent is at the ancient snow valley ruins site of grace in the mountaintops of the giants . talk to her to learn about miquella's haligtree and to reveal that is her next stop on her journey. she'll move on after you've exhausted all of her dialogue and made it to miquella's haligtree. the next place you'll see millicent is at the prayer room site of grace in miquella's haligtree. here you'll learn about her connection to malenia, blade of miquella and millicent's plan to return malenia's dignity to her. once again, there are no further actions you need to take here outside of exhausting her dialogue; doing so and reloading the area will reveal that she has moved on once more. in elphael, brace of the haligtree you'll need to reach the elphael inner wall site of grace , in the northern part of miquella's haligtree to make your way to the boss fight against malenia, blade of miquella . getting there requires you to reach the drainage channel site of grace , but before this, you'll need to cross a river of rot from the elphael inner wall . when you cross the river of rot, you'll see a doorway that leads you to the drainage channel site of grace, but instead of going through the door, head up to the left and cross the branches to the small body of rot water in the south corner of the room. walk into the water to get an ulcerated tree spirit to emerge. upon defeating this field boss, two summoning stones will appear. one is gold and one is red. choosing the gold one allows you to be summoned to assist millicent, while the red one allows you to challenge her. if you challenge millicent, you'll get millicent's prosthesis for defeating her. you will also find gowry dead if you return to his shack. if you assist millicent, you'll receive the rotten winged sword insignia and be able to return to the summoning stones to speak with her some more. if you choose the former, her quest will end here, but if you choose the latter, defeat her sisters in combat and then return to your own world. head over to the summoning stones again, then drop down to where millicent is on the ground. speak to her, and she'll tell you that she removed the needle. reload the area or rest at the site of grace and make your way back to where she was sitting. millicent will now be laying dead on the floor and you will be able to retrieve the unalloyed gold needle from her body. to use the unalloyerd gold needle , you'll need to beat malenia, blade of miquella . you will then be given the option to return the unalloyed gold needle to the flower left behind in malenia's boss room. doing so will grant you miquella's needle as well as a somber ancient dragon smithing stone . miquella's needle will allow you to change the ending if you choose to follow the hyetta questline ; this will give you the freedom to cure yourself of the frenzied flame )if you chose to be embraced by the three fingers) and allow you to pursue the other potential endings for the game. /n tanith is one of the many npcs you'll encounter that has a side quest to complete in elden ring. for this part of our elden ring guide, you'll find details of where to find her, how to begin her questline, and the outcomes of your choices along the way. tanith can be found in the volcano manor , accessible from the altus plateau ; head straight through the front door and make your way to the back of the room to find her sitting next to her knight. speak to her to prompt her to ask you to join the volcano manor. to fully progress her questline, you will need to say yes. at this point, you will be given the drawing-room key that will let you access the locked doors off of the first floor throne room in which tanith sits. exploring this area will reveal the npcs recusant bernahl , rya and diallos , as well as a letter on the table. picking up the letter and returning it to tanith will prompt her to ask you to carry out a series of assassinations. there is no time limit on completing these, although defeating rykard will lock you out of this part of the quest. the first assassination is old knight istvan , located north of the warmaster's shack in limgrave. upon invading his world and defeating him, you'll be given a rune arc and furlcalling finger remedy . return to volcano manor , and speak to bernahl before returning to tanith, as this will unlock him as a vendor. speaking to tanith will net you a magma shot , as well as a bit of dialogue letting you know you're a fully-fledged member of volcano manor . go back to the room with the npcs to collect the letter for your second target. picking up the second letter will automatically mark the target on your map. this one is rileigh the idle , who can be invaded south of the bridge of iniquity on the altus plateau . killing rileigh will reward you with crepus's vial and some black-key bolts . return to tanith and tell her about the success to receive a serpentbone blade . tanith will also tell you that if you continue on this path, you'll be able to meet rykard. go back to the room with the npcs to receive your final letter. note that this is your final mission for this quest; upon completing it, diallos and rya will have left the manor, albeit temporarily. however, do not depart on your quest just yet. instead, speak to bernahl to receive the letter to bernahl, which requests the assassination of two tarnished, unrelated to your final mission: vargram the raging wolf and errant sorcerer wilhelm (who can be found near the divine bridge on the altus plateau ). bernahl will join you when you invade their world, and defeating them earns you: raging wolf helm raging wolf armor raging wolf gauntlets raging wolf greaves when you return to volcano manor, bernahl will reward you with gelmir's fury . at this point, diallos will also be back at the manor. your final assassination target is juno hoslow, knight of blood . you can find his invasion sign at the mountaintops of the giants , by the shack of the lofty . upon defeating him you'll receive: hoslow's petal whip hoslow's helm hoslow's armor hoslow's gauntlets hoswlow's greaves return to tanith after you've completed the final assassination. she'll reward you with a taker's cameo and will ask if you're ready to see the lord. you can choose to accept or not at this point (you will be able to fight rykard regardless). if you say yes, tanith will transport you to the lord's chamber . when you arrive, there will be the audience pathway site of grace for you to activate. head through the boss room fog wall and pick up serpent-hunter sword from the corpse on the left before taking on the god-devouring serpent . once you've defeated the god-devouring serpent , it will be revealed to be rykard, lord of blasphemy . you can find more details on how to defeat this main boss on that page. when you've beaten rykard, lord of blasphemy , you'll receive rykard's great rune and remembrance of the blasphemous . speak to tanith again and she'll say that rykard was weak, and that she is planning to leave the volcano manor. if you rest at a site of grace, tanith (as well as all other npcs) will be gone from the volcano manor. return to rykard's chamber, and you'll find tanith crouched over rykard’s corpse. as you approach, it will become apparent that she is eating his remains. at this point, you can leave tanith to her meal or choose to put her out of her misery. while she will die in a single hit, her knight will invade you immediately and silently, so be prepared to turn around and do battle with a defector crucible knight . upon defeating him, he will drop the aspect of the crucible incantation; reloading the area will allow you to grab tanith’s clothing and thus bring her questline to a close. however, if you are choosing to complete rya's questline , return to the throne room to find the tonic of forgetfulness key item. /n brother corhyn is one of the many npcs you'll encounter that has a main quest to complete in elden ring. for this part of our elden ring guide, you'll find details of where to find him, how to begin and progress his questline, as well as how to complete it such that it unlocks one of the possible endings for the game. you'll first meet brother corhyn in the roundtable hold . upon first meeting him you will not yet be able to progress his questline; you must first give him at least one prayerbook to activate his quest. during his time at the roundtable hold, you will be able to use him as a vendor for incantations . after talking to him a few times, he says that he's considering leaving, to go out and find the noble goldmask . once you've reached the altus plateau, brother corhyn will leave the roundtable hold; you can now find him near the waypoint where you can collect the altus plateau map fragment . exhaust his dialogue here, then head north to find goldmask, which is required to get corhyn to move to his third location. goldmask can be found on the broken bridge by the road of iniquity side path . to get there, go north from the bower of bounty site of grace until you find the spiritspring located just north of the first broken bridge fragment. orient yourself east and ride the spiritspring up to land on the bridge to find goldmask. note that attempting to talk to him here has no impact on corhyn's quest, as goldmask doesn't actually speak. return to brother corhyn and tell him where goldmask is. he'll tell you that he'll soon leave to go and find goldmask himself. return to the aforementioned bridge to find corhyn and exhaust his dialogue here, as well as reactive him as an incantations vendor. you can find brother corhyn and goldmask again when you reach leyndell, royal capital. in the southwest side of the capital, by the colosseum, you'll find brother corhyn and goldmask. speak to him and ask about goldmask, and he'll tell you that they're working on solving the mystery of radagon's true identity. to help them, go to the erdtree sanctuary site of grace and climb up the tree towards the queen's bedchamber . instead of taking the path to the queen's bedchamber , turn towards the golden roof on the left (just after you exit the door). jump to the roof and head towards the open window. follow the balcony around until you reach a navigable tree branch; walk along that to circle back into the chamber where you found godfrey, first elden lord (golden shade) . here, you should see a corpse on a chair suspended from the ceiling, with an item floating on it. this will give you the golden order principia , which you must give to brother corhyn to progress his quest. once you've given him the golden order principia, you'll need to purchase the law of regression incantation from him. it costs 10,000 runes and requires your intelligence to be level 37. if you don't have this, you can use rennala in the grand library at the academy of raya lucaria to respec using a larval tear (and respec back again if you wish, after you've completed the questline). note that you will have to have beaten her in her boss form to be able to respec with her. once you have the incantation and your intelligence is level 37, go to the erdtree sanctuary site of grace . take a left, heading west from here. follow the path down and into the building, then take the lift to the bottom. from here, go down the first set of stairs and face the statue with its arms out wide to the southeast. look for the glowing white message sign and interact with it to see this message: regression alone reveals secrets. use the law of regression in front of the statue of radagon to dispel the illusion hiding radagon's alternate form. this will also unlock a new message, which reads as follows (note: major endgame spoiler): tap to reveal . return to brother corhyn and goldmask and tell them of what you learned. exhaust brother corhyn's dialogue here to get him and goldmask to move to their next location. brother corhyn and goldmask will move to the mountaintops of the giants next. you can find them just south of the stargazer ruins, on the grass-covered bridge. corhyn confides in you that he is beginning to doubt goldmask. if you've completed the rya questline at volcano manor and still have the tonic of forgetfulness, you can give this to brother corhyn here to ease his misgivings. note that doing so will not impact your ability to acheive the ending associated with goldmask; it only affects brother corhyn's final location. if you did not choose to give corhyn the tonic of forgetfulness , you will find him again in leyndell. upon defeating maliketh, the black blade , you will automatically be returned to leyndell, now covered in ash. navigate south from the leyndell, capital of ash site of grace until you see the larger helix spear protruding from the ash. corhyn is located at the base of this spear. speak to him here to exhaust his dialogue, then reload the area to receive corhyn's robes and corhyn's bell bearing . here you'll also find goldmask's body, but this time, at the very bottom of the cliffs. interact with the body to collect the mending rune of perfect order. you can use this after the final boss battle, to unlock one of the alternative endings the age of order ending. /n diallos is one of the many npcs you'll encounter that has a side quest to complete in elden ring. for this part of our elden ring wiki guide , you'll find details of where to find him, how to begin his questline, and the outcomes of your choices along the way. you'll encounter diallos when you go to the roundtable hold for the first time. speak with him and he'll tell you about lanya, his companion, who is missing. he will ask you to keep an eye out for her on your travels. as you move towards the academy of raya lucaria in liurnia of the lakes, you'll see diallos again near academy gate town. from the site of grace, head north to find diallos standing over the body of lanya, mourning her. speak to him, then travel to the roundtable hold where he will be again. exhaust his dialogue here again to have him move to volcano manor . at volcano manor, you can find him in the drawing room where you'll pick up the letters for the tanith questline assassinations. he will be to the right of bernhal. speak to him each time you complete your first assassination and he will leave volcano manor , returning later on looking defeated. once you've completed the volcano manor quests, diallos will leave along with everyone else. the next place you'll see diallos is jarburg , south of the carian study hall. you can find him in one of the little shacks, talking to a jar. he says that he's forging his own path now, after leaving volcano manor . leave the area and allow some time to pass (around 3-4 in-game days) to find that a poacher attacked jarburg in the interim, slaughtering all the jar people. diallos will be laying on the ground, mortally wounded after attempting to defend the jars. he will ask if he was successful in defending the town; whether or not you choose to be truthful here has no impact on his quest. upon reloading the area, jar-bairn will now be standing near diallos, and will express their desire to become a great warrior like diallos. reloading the area one final time will allow you to retrieve hoslow's petal whip, diallos's mask, and a numen's rune from diallos' body. /n fia is one of the many npcs you'll encounter that has a main quest to complete in elden ring. for this part of our elden ring guide, you'll find details of where to find her, how to begin her questline, and the outcomes of any choices to make along the way. note that fia is one of a handful of npcs whose quest can affect the outcome of the game. fia can be found in the roundtable hold , in the room just before hewg . you can speak to her the first time you arrive there and she'll ask if she can hold you. you can accept or refuse the hug; if she does hug you, you'll receive a debuff (which you can learn how to remove here: how to remove fia's hug debuff ). if you speak to fia a few times, new dialogue becomes available. to progress her individual storyline, you'll need to have started the ranni the witch questline . when you've reached the point in ranni's questline where you receive the carian inverted statue , you should return to the study hall entrance site of grace in liurnia and place the statue on the pedestal. this will invert carian hall , and you'll want to make your way down once you go inside. carefully drop down onto the chandeliers to reach the lift, which will take you all the way up to liurnia tower bridge . you'll need to cross this bridge (you can choose to fight or flee from the godskin noble here) and reach the divine tower of liurnia on the other side. when you reach the top, approach the body and pick up the cursemark of death . return to fia at the roundtable hold and speak to her. here you'll need to embrace her to be able to "talk in secret." at this point, fia will give you some more information and then ask you to return a weathered dagger to its owner. speaking to d, hunter of the dead will now present the option to give him the aforementioned dagger. speak to d and give him the weathered dagger. he will ask where you got the dagger, but ultimately decides it doesn't matter and says he'll return it to them. reload the area and head to where roderika and hewg are located; here you'll see that the door at the end of the hallway near them is now open. entering it will reveal fia standing over d's corpse. fia will admit to her treachery and her status as a deathbed companion, and then disappear from the roundtable hold. to figure out where to go next requires a clue from the rogier questline . if rogier dies, he leaves a note that says: "i forgot to tell you, but it seems d has a younger brother. i heard he lies in a deep sleep in the aqueduct beside the eternal city of nokron. and it's said he stood before the prince of death not far beyond that spot." this hint points to the fact you need to head to the siofra river to continue this questline. head north from the ancient grounds site of grace (away from nokron) to find the aqueduct to which rogier was referring. be wary, as there are two crucible knights here, one of which is waiting at the top of a waterfall. head into the aqueduct, away from the crucible knight, to eventually find d's brother collapsed against a railing before a stairway upward. depending on how far you have progressed d's questline, you may have the option here to give d's brother the twisted armor set . here you'll also be able to continue ahead to a boss battle with two valiant gargoyles . to continue fia's questline, you will need to dispatch these two; upon doing so, head to the open coffin at the very back of the room and interact with it. choosing to do so will activate a cutscene that results in your arrival at a new location. this will take you to deeproot depths , where you'll need to make your way across twisted erdtree roots into the destroyed city. make your way up the branches to reach a site of grace called across the roots. from the deeproot depths site of grace, head upwards past the stone enemies spewing flame, navigating the roots and crumbling towers of the abandoned city. eventually, you will see a ledge below you; jump to it to reveal the across the roots site of grace. activate this site of grace then look to the wall of the ledge to see a hole that leads into a large open space with a massive misshapen corpse entangled in the roots on the far wall. here, you will engage in a serial boss fight, wherein you will be taking on a series of fia's champions. these will include recognizable npcs such as lionel the lionhearted and rogier . upon defeating her champions and reloading the area, fia will be present, sitting below godwyn's corpse on the far wall of the arena. speaking to fia again will allow you the option to have her hold you, which will provide another powerful buff (this time with no debuff effect). give her the cursemark of death and choose to talk in secret with her to learn of her plans to lay with godwyn. if you rest at the site of grace, then return to fia, you'll be presented with the option to enter a deathbed dream. choosing to do this will bring you to the optional boss fight with lichdragon fortissax . defeat lichdragon fortissax to leave the deathbed dream. upon doing so, you will see an item on fia's corpse; collect it to receive the mending rune of the death prince from her. using this ruin on marika's body after the final boss fight will allow you to achieve the age of duskborn ending. note that for this to be possible, you will need to have not opted to embrace the frenzied flame, as that will lock you out of all other endings. /n dung eater is one of the npcs you'll encounter that has a main quest to complete in elden ring. for this part of our elden ring guide, you'll find details of where to find him, how to begin his questline, and how to get the ending associated with him. you can first find dung eater at the roundtable hold. this will happen later in the game when you've made it to leyndell, royal capital . the room next to the twin maiden husks will open, revealing the red apparition of dung eater. in order to progress his quest, you'll need seedbed curse otherwise, he will tell you to leave him alone. when you deliver the first seedbed curse to dung eater, he'll give you a sewer-gaol key that can be used to unlock the sewer beneath leyndell, royal capital . head north from the lower capital church , near the destroyed part of the city beyond the wings of the dragon. there's a well here you can drop down into. right by the ladder of the well, you'll see a cell to open. unlock this and walk through and climb down the ladder. head right and down into the rat-infested room and clear this. go through the door to the southeast, then take the ladder on the left down and head for the site of grace that's in the second alcove to the left (northwest). go left from this site of grace, and drop down through the open grate in the floor also on the left. take the path to the right, go past the poisonous flowers and climb up the ladder. be careful as you reach the middle of this room, as a giant hand will appear from the ground (and two smaller hands will also appear). you want to run to the cell on the right, and open this with the sewer-gaol key . talk to dung eater and he'll ask who you are. choose leave your gaol! and then return to the roundtable hold and head to the room where you first spoke to dung eater. he'll have disappeared, but a message remains that says: "i'll defile you next. come to the outer moat." the outer moat that dung eater is referring to, is the small body of water on the map just northwest of the capital rampart site of grace . as you walk into the water, you'll be invaded by dung eater. kill him and he'll drop a sword of milos . go back to the roundtable hold and dung eater will be there again. speak to him again and he'll ask you to defile his flesh with the seedbed curse. this will require you to collect seedbed curse and keep taking it to him. when you first enter the capital, from the east rampart site of grace, you'll make your way into a room with a lift on the right-hand side. take this down, then enter the room with the perfumer. climb the ladder here, then go all the way to the top. there's a corpse in a chair here that has the first seedbed curse you need to make dung eater give you the sewer-gaol key. if you've started the rya questline , you should have encountered the blackguard at boilprawn shack in liurnia of the lacks. eventually, the blackguard will move to the outer moat near leyndell, royal capital . you can talk to him and he'll warn you about dung eater at the moat. leave the area and return, to find the blackguard dying. he'll drop a seedbed curse when he does, and dung eater will invade you. inside the fortified manor, you'll see a room that resembles the one the dung eater can be found in at the roundtable hold. to get here, leave the fortified manor, go right and use the wooden shacks to climb up onto the second floor. this will take you to a replica of the roundtable hold. locate the room that dung eater is in at the normal roundtable hold, to find the corsep with the seedbed curse. getting to this room requires you to unlock one of the imp seal statues . to reach this, start at the temple of eiglay site of grace , where you'll need to defeat the godskin noble . from here, take the lift up to the second floor and go outside on to the balcony. follow this round until you can drop down onto a ledge to the right, with the lava and slugs. take this path up, to the left, with the volcano waterfall, then into the building with a jail cell door near the abductor virgin. there's a broken window you can jump in, then open the cell door. when you've opened this door, continue along this path until you come to another part of the manor. open the door on the right to reveal an altar. go up the stairs to the left, turning back on yourself and up. through this door is an imp statue seal that requires two stonesword keys . when inside here, drop down safely from the crates to reach the bottom of the room. you should see a corpse in a chair at one end of the room that has the seedbed curse on it. from the prayer room site of grace go northeast until you reach the section where there are stairs going up and down. take the stairs down, and jump onto the slanted archway to the right of the enemy looking out from the balcony. then jump over to the left, where the scarab is. there is another archway on the other side here, leading up to the left. go up here and the corpse is at the far end of this ledge, to the northwest. from the prayer room site of grace , go northeast and take the stairs down until you reach the room with the two knights. don't go inside this room, jump off the ledge to the right (which is just below the first slanted archway you jumped on for the above seedbed curse). drop down to your right, to land on the roof. then turn around and go in the doorway underneath the arch. go down the stairs to the right, then in the northeast corner of the room, at the very end on the ledge, there's a corpse. you'll need five of the seedbed curse to unlock one of the additional endings in the game. this is the blessing of despair ending . once you have given over five of the seedbed curse to dung eater, he'll give you the mending rune of the fell curse . you can use this after the final boss battle, to see the blessing of despair ending. /n jar-bairn is one of the many npcs you'll encounter that has an optional side quest in elden ring. for this part of our elden ring wiki guide , you'll find details of where to find him, how to begin his questline, and the outcome of any choices you make that may impact his story. jar-bairn was introduced to elden ring as part of update 1.03 ., added as an npc with a questline integrated with both alexander the iron fist and diallos . you can find him in jarburg , just south of the carian study hall in liurnia of the lankes. upon entering the area from the south, look to the left to see him perched on the edge of a building's stoop. when you first speak to jar-bairn, he'll ask if you're to be the new potentate for the village. to progress his quest, you must answer in the affirmative, although he will ultimately reject you for this role regardless. exhaust his dialogue, and then reload the area and speak to him again to access the next leg of his quest. upon reloading the area and speaking to him again, jar-bairn will tell you about the rare flowers growing in jarburg and indicate that you're free to pick them. pick a handful (you don't need to get every one) and then rest at the nearby site of grace. exhaust his dialogue again--this time concerning his uncle alexander, presumed to be alexander the iron fist--and then rest at the site of grace yet again to unlock more dialogue and the next leg of jar-bairn's questline. once you've unlocked jar-bairn's dialogue concerning poachers, reload the area to chat with jar-bairn again to learn that the new jarburg potentate has arrived. head to one of the eastern shacks in the village to find the village's new potentate, diallos . speaking to diallos here will reveal that he's found a new lease on life as the potentate of jarburg, and that he's happy to put his old life behind him. after you've exhausted diallos' dialogue, leave jarburg for a time to unlock the penultimate step of jar-bairn's quest. returning to jarburg will reveal the slaughter of the pot denizens of the village (the only way this can be prevented is to completely avoid this questline to begin with). find jar-bairn in the center of the path through the village, about halfway along; speak to him to learn that the poachers visited, but that diallos valiantly fought them off. look just beyond jar-bairn to see diallos laying mortally wounded upon the ground. after exhausting diallos' dialogue and reloading the area, the jar-bairn will have moved to be next to diallos' body. speak to him here and then reload the area once more to find him back at his customary spot on the stoop of a village building. exhaust his dialogue, wherein he will mention his hopes to set out on a journey to become a warrior jar. from here, you may now proceed to the final part of jar-bairn's quest. the final part of jar-bairn's questline links with the alexander the iron fist questline . if you have been keeping up with alexander's questline, you will meet him in crumbling farum azula, where he will challenge you to a duel. to complete jar-bairn's quest, you must defeat alexander and receive the key item alexander's innards . return to jarburg and present these to jar-bairn and reload the area one final time to receive the companion jar talisman from where the jar-bairn had been sitting and officially end his quest. /n this page includes a complete

this page includes information on how to defeat margit, including tips, attacks to watch out for, and how to use a secret item to weaken him. margit the fell is located at the entrance of the stormveil castle , at the top northwest side of west limgrave. you will not be able to access the rest of the legacy dungeon until he is defeated. margit is something of a skill check in elden ring, as he's way more imposing and fearsome than any mini boss you've likely fought in the smaller dungeons of west limgrave. if you've been avoiding these places or raced straight here, he may prove to be insurmountable, and it is highly recommend you gain experience and gear by clearing out the smaller dungeons of west limgrave before attempting this fight. margit is a wary fighter, but don't let his slow pacing or knobbled cane fool you, he can hit incredibly hard - not just with his cane, but with his ability to summon holy weapons at a moment's notice to strike you with. you'll also be fighting on a somewhat narrow bridge, with chasms on both sides that he can and will knock you off of if you don't position yourself with your back to the middle as much as possible. as stated previously, margit can sometimes be very cautious unlike many bosses, and may slowly strafe you at a distance, inviting attacks. this can be a good opportunity for ranged and magic attacks, but you'll need to be ready to move at a moment's notice - particularly when he summons holy daggers to toss your way. as you draw close, be prepared for several types of attacks he can unleash: getting close often prompts him to use a rapid upward swing from his staff that's difficult to anticipate, and can still deal damage if your shield isn't fully absorbing hits. he'll follow this up by slamming the weapon down again, but after a short delay - meaning you can quickly get behind him and counter with a few blows while his animation plays out - just watch for a quick tail lash follow up if you stay behind him for too long. he can employ a series of swings from his preferred weapon in horizontal sweeps (which can be parried if you're timing things right), and often combine them by summoning a holy dagger to slice at a faster rate, before jumping backwards and throwing it at you. he may also simply performing a retreating swing from his staff as he jumps back to increase distance from you. other times, he may start to hold his staff high in one hand while walking forward before slamming it down vertically in front of him. one of his more iconic attacks is to slowly raise his cane above his head and hold it high with two hands. he'll wind it up with a long delay, and then finally send it crashing down fast in front of him - but you can dodge once the weapon is on its way down. if you retreat from this attack, he'll leap forward after smashing down and use a follow up attack to get close to you, but you can dodge roll behind his leaping swing. sometimes at range, he'll begin to jog forward, and jump high into the air to slam down with his cane like a speartip into the ground. it's a powerful move, but also easier to dodge and get behind him, giving you lots of time to attack him as he slowly removes the weapon from the ground. at around half health, he'll admit you have some strength, but summon a might holy hammer, and swing it in an arc in front of him to gain momentum to launch into the air, and slam it down on top of you. backpedal away from the initial swing, and wait until he's about to crash down to dodge out of the way of the hammer and retaliate - but be ready for followup dagger swings. he can also start to summon a longer golden sword blade, with more reach than his daggers, and can use it in conjunction with his cane to perform spinning combo slashes that are difficult to avoid, or end with a stab with his main staff weapon. margit can be very hard to predict which magical weapons he'll summon and how he'll incorporate them into his combo attacks, so you'll always want to have stamina in reserve to quickly block or dodge his next move. if you have an adequate absorbing shield, you can even perform guard counters, provided you make sure he's finished his combo strike before you launch your counter, or you'll likely take more damage once committed to the attack. while you can summon allies or even a sorcerer npc named rogier to assist you in battle, you should also take advantage of spirit summons to help you in the fight against margit. they won't increase the difficulty of the fight, and you can use their help to distract his attention away to get off strong attacks and possibly stagger him under your combined attacks. take your time with this fight, as he moves slowly enough to give you time to watch his attack animations and get a feel for the right and wrong times to try your own attacks - and never get too greedy so you leave yourself open. melee fighters should back off every now and then to regain full stamina and wait for him to make the first move so you can react accordingly. get your hits in where you can to slowly whittle margit down, and he'll fall with enough practice, clearing the way to stormveil castle proper. /n godrick the grafted is the main boss of the stormveil castle dungeon and the first elden lord you are likely to encounter during your journey through elden ring. check out our boss strategy below to learn how to beat this great foe: godrick the grafted is the first of the shardbearer demigods you will face in elden ring. he is distinguished by his twisted body which is made up of his servants limbs that he has grafted onto his own broken body. similar to the grafted scion, many of godrick's attacks are multi-part and multi-hit and he has some erratic movements that might catch you off guard. at half health he will graft a dragon head onto his arm that opens up some new attacks and modifies others with fire damage , so be careful if your shield does not have high fire resist. thankfully in both forms godrick's attacks are highly telegraphed, highly punishable, and he is generally slow moving which leads to a fairly readable fight once you've clocked the patterns. if you've been fighting godrick for a while, be sure to pay attention to how godrick telegraphs his attacks. understanding them will lead you ever closer to victory. additionally, you can summon nepheli just outside the boss door if you need a little extra help (or a distraction). below is our general boss guide for besting godrick: in general you can stick relatively close to godrick if you are a melee attacker. his axe sweeps seem to have the biggest hitbox at the ends, so if you dodge roll toward godrick you will generally avoid them and end up in a good spot to punish. just remember that most of these are combo attacks , so be sure you manage your stamina and wait for the final attack if you plan to guard counter . if you are really unsure you can stay further out of range and wait for one of his slow overhead slam attacks which are easy to punish. another easy to see move is his aerial slam , which he telegraphs by grabbing the head of his axe with his off hand and leaping into the air. dodge as he comes down then get in a 2-4 hit combo while he is standing back up. another punishable move is his rolling slam . he will whip up the air around himself and then roll on the ground before leaping up into the air and slamming into the ground. walk toward him while he is in the air and he will sail right over you, letting you get in some back slashes while he is recovering. with nepheli's help you can stagger godrick and get a critical attack in. let her become his focus, then get in a bunch of side and back strikes while he is trying to strike her. just pay close attention to his movements because he can change focus back to you in an instant. with his dragon hand on there are only a few more moves to pay attention to. the most dangerous is probably the dragon breath which has a large area of effect and can hit multiple times. he telegraphs this one by raising the dragon head into the air as its mouth starts to leak flames. try to move to the side or back to avoid the brunt of the blast. the other is the fiery rock attack which he telegraphs by dragging the dragon head across the ground in a circle before blasting fiery rocks into the air. you can run toward him and let the rocks sail over your head, or simply run away and heal up while the rocks burn out on the ground. if you are feeling extra confident you can equip a gold-pickled fowl foot and use it before killing godrick to rake in some extra runes. defeating him will get you godrick's great rune and the remembrance of the grafted . for more boss guides, be sure to visit the boss guides

radagon is located at the debate parlor site of grace in the academy of raya lucaria in north liurnia, and is located roughly halfway through the legacy dungeon. red wolf of radagon might just be the toughest enemy yet. similar to the lion we faced in stormveil keep the red wolf is both quick and powerful, but he takes things up a notch by mixing projectiles in with his barrage of attacks. his bite and claw attacks are quick and usually part of multi-hit combos, so do not attempt to punish these unless you are absolutely certain it is the final attack. the red wolf can also summon a magic sword that it swings with its mouth. thankfully these attacks are much easier to see coming and easier to punish than his basic attacks. block the swings or dodge inward as he slashes and you should be able to hit back with 2-3 attacks or a guard counter. any time he backs off he will likely summon 1-3 homing spells which hang in the air for a moment before flying toward you. it is best to just back off anytime there are in play, as you don't want to risk getting struck by the wolf and his spells at the same time. follow these instructions and you should be able to wear him down and defeat him, claiming his memory stone and a new site of grace as your prize. /n rennala, queen of the full moon is the boss of the academy of raya lucaria dungeon and the second elden lord you are likely to encounter during your journey through elden ring. check out our boss strategy below to learn how to beat this great foe: rennala, queen of the full moon is a powerful sorcerer and elden lord who serves as the leader of the academy of raya lucaria. this battle has two phases, the first of which is more of a puzzle than a battle. rennala will float around overhead while her minions crawl around on the ground, pelting you with flying books and fire breath. you need to look around the room and identify which of her minions is singing, then go and attack that minion to end their song, which causes another to start up. after striking three of the minions rennala's protective shell will shatter and she will fall to the ground, allowing you to get in some attacks before she rises back into the air. she will trigger a magical explosion before she rises again, so be sure to back up when you see her building her spell. repeat this process until you deplete her health bar, triggering phase two. in phase two, rennala will face you directly with her full arsenal of spells. this includes: a magic laser she telegraphs by summons a large magic orb, which then shrinks into her hand before firing directly at you. this can be dodged by rolling left or right just before she fires. a barrage of homing crystals that acts sort of like a magic shotgun. you can tell this is coming if the tip of her staff gets spiky. as long as you aren't directly in front of these you can simply side step them as they chase you. a barrage of slower moving homing missiles, usually summoned when she dodges away from your attacks. just like the homing crystals these can be easily avoided by just side stepping or rolling into them before impact. a powerful magic bolt. she slightly floats off the ground just before letting this one loose. you can avoid this by simply dodging toward her as the spell comes towards you. a magic boomerang of sorts, this one flies toward you and spins around you for a few seconds, hitting multiple times and wearing down your endurance before flying back to her. her signature attack, she floats into the air and encases herself in a small moon before falling back to the ground. the moon then descends and makes impact with the ground, causing a massive explosion. the best action when you see this coming is just to run away. as you can see, the basic strategy here is to never stop moving. you constantly want to be strafing around her in the midrange, giving you time to react to her spells and charge in when an opening presents itself. the most punishable of these spells are the magic laser and the magic bolt, so keep an eye out for those above all. when she reaches about half health she will begin summoning various ash spirits to help her battle. these make things even more complicated when it comes to dodging, so your best bet is to just run away for the 15-30 seconds that the spirit persists for, then run in and attack her in the downtime between them. she can summon a troll, a dragon, an assassin, and wolves. her summon animation has a long cooldown, so if you are in position use the opportunity to land 2-3 strikes. your reward for defeating her is the remembrance of the full moon queen , and the great rune of the unborn . after the battle you will be returned to the original boss chamber where you can speak with rennala to change your appearance, and respec your character if you have a larval tear . /n starscourge radahn is a powerful elden lord who stalks the wailing wastes, and can be considered the boss of redmane castle . the battle against him is an interesting mix of fun and challenge, but can be a little tedious and random. check out our boss strategy guide below to learn more about how to bear this great foe: starscourge radahn is a powerful elden lord who stalks the wailing wastes. the battle against him is an interesting mix of fun and challenge, but can be a little tedious and random. the battle will begin the instant you spawn into the wailing wastes, and radahn will begin firing powerful arrows at you right away. wait until the moment just before the arrow reaches you, then dodge roll side to side. you need to do this a few times at the start of the fight, so keep your eye on him at all times. the gimmick of this battle is that you get to summon a handful of npcs to assist you in the festival. you will see their summon signs scattered all over the sand in front of you. dash over to the signs and summon the npcs in-between arrow shots until all of the possible allies have been summoned so that the real battle can begin. the allies you can summon include: great horned tragoth, who wields a giant hammer lionel the lionhearted, who summons large groups of homing souls okina, a samurai who uses fiery blood slice attacks alexander the iron fist , the warrior jar you may have met earlier in the game blaidd the half-wolf , another warrior you may have met earlier as part of ranni's questline patches (if you met and didn't kill him, though he'll take a few steps before deciding to quickly leave instead of fighting) finger maiden therolina, who can be summoned near the top of the dunes and will invoke healing spells to try and bolster the group radahn will change up his strategy and start firing shotgun blasts of arrows as well as a homing rain of arrows. during this period just strafe around at a safe distance until your npc army reach him and he switches to melee attacks. at this point you want to hop on torrent and run in with the rest of your allies. mounting up for this battle isn't 100% required, but due to the incredible onslaught of his moves, it's highly recommended to stay mobile on horseback unless you are an expert at dodging rapid attacks. this is where the battle becomes a little unpredictable. radahn has many powerful wide reaching attacks, and he moves around incredibly fast. he will start lashing out at the various summoned npcs, killing most of them with ease. it is during these periods of distraction that you want to dash past on torrent and execute a hit and run. try and pick a weapon with good range and damage because you will only be hitting him once or twice per pass (bleed doesn't hurt either). try to mostly hit him in the back, as he will likely be attacking forward when trying to hit your summoned allies. your goal is to never be the center of attention, and run away any time he turns to you. stick around too long, and it's more than likely you'll be caught in a sweeping strike, stunning torrent long enough that you won't be able to dash away in time to evade a killing blow. keep in mind that most of his attacks are multi-hit combos. his most punishable attacks are his double weapon overhead slams. he has 2-3 different ones so just keep an eye on him. anytime you see him slam both his weapons into the ground is an opening to attack. just be careful of the purple charged blades, which result in a massive explosion when he pulls them back out of the ground. if you are lucky your allies may even hit him enough times to trigger a stagger, at which point you can hop off torrent and get a powerful attack in. you should also consider crafting tons of rowa raisins to feed torrent during parts of the battle where you're not under attack. losing torrent in a battle like this can often spell instant death, and your mount doesn't always regen to full health when you die and respawn - so top him off before going back for another attempt! radahn also has a few ranged blade attacks to keep in mind, the first a volley of purple orbs that can be easily dodged by strafing. the second is a wave of electricity that runs across the ground, which you need to double-jump over with torrent - and leaping over this dive attack can often give you a free hit or two. when radahn reaches 50% health he will leap into the sky, disappearing from the battle for about 10 seconds. use this time to heal and look for any nearby summon signs, which will reappear for anyone who was killed during phase one. keep an eye on the sky, because you will be able to see radahn coming as he shoots back down to earth. at this point, you'll also get one more ally to summon who has been added to the mix: castellan jerren, the master of ceremonies for the festival who wields a fiery flamberge. in phase two radahn gains some new tricks, but with your refreshed gang of summoned allies backing you the strategy remains mostly the same. his attacks become more powerful and gain wider ranges or more serious effects. you need to focus up and redouble your efforts here and not let the fight go long enough for radahn to kill all your allies again, or use his powerful meteor summons which are both difficult to dodge and deadly. all in all, this is a boss battle that can be considered at least partially luck based. if your summoned allies stay alive and do their job radahn may never even look at you, letting you get free hits and staggers. but if he kills them all off with one or two combos you may be left running for your life. once you've mastered the above mentioned patterns it will just come down to the number of attempts, so keep at it and eventually the festival will end with you the victor. killing radahn will get you the remembrance of the starscourge , and radahn's great rune . it will also trigger a cutscene that shows a meteor landing somewhere on the map, which will trigger a continuation of ranni's questline... /n the godskin noble is the first major boss of the volcano manor dungeon in elden ring. the godskin noble is located at the temple of eiglay site of grace in the volcano manor in mt gelmir, and is located roughly halfway through the legacy dungeon. check out our boss strategy below to learn how to beat this great foe: given the relative easiness of the final boss of volcano manor, the godskin noble might as well be the true boss of this area. he is a powerful foe who uses a mix of quick melee attacks and black fire magic, and his surprising speed lets him cover long distances quickly. it can be hard to figure out when you can possible get an attack in, especially when he enters his even more erratic second phase. first things first, you're going to want a 100% physical block shield, even better if it has the barricade shield ability. keep your shield up and keep an eye out for a few different attacks: circular swing into forward jab : this one is very obvious thanks to the exaggerated way he swings his sword in a circle for the first hit. block the circle swing, then guard counter the jab, or roll toward him then sneak in 1-2 attacks. hilt slam : this one is dangerous due to the high damage, but very punishable. he will raise the sword hilt above his head and lift his foot, before slamming the hilt into the ground. he almost always does two slams, so dodge roll into him at the moment of him impact to avoid the damage then get in an attack or counter. lunge and jab : he usually does this one if you are in the mid range. he does an exaggerated stutter-step to moev forward, then does one quick jab. block it and guard counter. backhand punch : probably his simplest move, the noble will slowly pull his arm back and twist his body, then swing at you with the back of his hand . block this for an easy guard counter. if he summons the ring of fire you want to roll out as quickly as possible. do not risk getting trapped inside with him as the flames can stagger you, opening you up to more attacks. also keep an eye out for his fireball attack. if you see him charging it up start moving forward. dodge the fireball as it soars toward you and you might be able to get in one attack as he's waving the fire from his hand. around half health he will float into the air and charge himself up with a fiery explosion before entering phase two, so back off to avoid the damage. from here he will almost always open with one of his new attacks by inflating his body, which will push you away, then either roll around the room like a wheel or slowly float into the air before slamming down. the float can be easily avoided by just backing off or dodging at the moment of the impact, but the roll is a little more complicated. your best bet is to try and weave between the pillars and hope he repeatedly bumps off of them and misses you, but you can also just follow his movements and dodge roll any time he gets close or block if you have enough stamina to hold up. in this phase he switches up his combos a little but you can mostly keep an eye out for the same attacks. another easily punishable attack at this point is his powerful forward thrust. he will telegraph this attack by raising his sword above his head, then pointing it forward and down. he will lunge forward powerfully, leaving himself wide open for a few seconds after. however, do not confuse this move with his rapid thrusts. before the rapid thrusts he will hold is sword vertically in front of himself for a moment, then let loose a flurry of thrusts which will easily break your guard then kill you. this is probably his most dangerous attack since you only have a moment to recognize it and react, but you will want to roll away or to the side as quickly as possible. as always be patient. wait for the right openings and keep yourself healthy as much as possible. wear the noble down with these strategies and you will be rewarded with his godskin stitcher and noble presence , the serpent's amnion key item, as well as a new site of grace, the temple of eiglay . /n rykard, lord of blasphemy , is one of the major bosses in elden ring and the leader of volcano manor . he seems to have been human once, but has since fused his body to the god-devouring serpent in hopes of devouring all the other gods. you can access the rykard boss fight in two ways: reaching the end of the volcano manor dungeon, or completing all of lady tanith's assassination missions. check out our boss strategy to defeating rykard below: rykard is more of a fun fight than a challenging fight, similar to the storm king from demon's souls and yhorm the giant from dark souls iii. upon entering the boss chamber you will find a dead body holding the serpent hunter weapon. this weapon unleashes massive power when used against rykard, making this fight (mostly) a breeze. the first phase of this fight is against the god-devouring serpent. because of the serpent hunter's long range you don't need to get all that close to hit him, and you wouldn't want to anyways because of the magma. find a spot where your light attack can hit the snake's head, then put up your shield and start swinging. the light attack takes very little stamina, so you should be able to attack a long time without stopping. the only concerns in this phase are his grab, which he telegraphs by opening his mouth wide and roaring and his poison breath which he telegraphs by leaking poison smoke from his mouth. you shouldn't be very close to the snake anyways, so just back up a little more if you see either of these attacks coming. when the coast is clear move in again and keep attacking until phase one is over. in phase two rykard will reveal his true form and equip his disgusting sword. from here on rykard will execute a mix of sweeping sword attacks (which are easily dodged with well-timed rolls, note the pause between his slam and sweep attack), explosive spells (which you can see coming, run or roll away between attacks), and snake head jabs, all while inching towards you. thankfully the strategy from phase one works just as well here, as long as you mix in a few more dodges when the spells come raining down. with good luck you can actually damage rykard down and kill him before he can really cause any trouble, but the worst case scenario is when he summons the red magic cloud above himself which causes numerous homing spells to start chasing you down. this combination of attacks becomes very hard to dodge, and you're almost better off just dying and hoping it doesn't happen next time. if you do manage to survive the barrage he will raise his sword skyward and slam it down with one last powerful attack before the cloud dispels. but like i said, that is worst case scenario. follow the strategy from phase one: shield up, light attack spam. you will block almost all of his outgoing damage (especially if you have a shield with barricade), and only need to worry about taking a few seconds here or there to let your stamina refill. killing rykard will get you the remembrance of the blaspemous and rykard's great rune . activate the site of grace, and grab the eye surcoat off the nearby body. from here you can return to volcano manor and speak with lady tanith, completing the manor's chain quest (return to the boss room after speaking with her to see a disturbing final scene). /n godfrey, first elden lord , is the first major boss located within leyndell, royal capital , and the final barrier to facing the final boss of the dungeon. godfrey is located past the west capital rampart site of grace, in the tower at the top of the giant branches that are growing out of the ramparts. check out our boss guide to defeating godfrey below: godfrey is a fairly classic humanoid boss. his moveset is made up of a variety of slow powerful axe swings, most of which are easily blocked with a 100% physical block shield, or simply rolled through before impact. he has almost no tricks save for a few deceptive combos, so of course we are going to adopt a similarly classic strategy to whup him. first thing, avoid his leaping axe throw attack that he opens the battle with my rolling in as he executes the throw. get control of the center of the room to get yourself some space. our game plan here is to stand just out of his normal range in an attempt to bait out one of his long range overhead slams or jump attacks. these are some of his most obvious swings and the most punishable, in particular the attack where he leaps into the air then jabs the ground with the point of his axe. if you see this attack be ready to punish with 2-3 attacks. when it comes to his weaker attacks you want to be more wary. his quick axe swipes and horizontal slashes are usually followed up by another quick attack or a slightly delayed heavier slam. i would not recommend trying to punish these unless you are using a very quick weapon. it is better to just wait for a familiar attack than to try and punish during a combo just because you are antsy. however the stomp, one of his more frequent attacks, does seem to be punishable if you can roll to his side and strike him from behind. because his combos are so delayed, you can even fit in a guard counter between most of his attacks. if you are feeling confident in your stamina and defense stand right in front of him and simply tank the swings (especially easy if you have the barricade shield ability) then counter repeatedly until you get the stagger. just be aware of your stamina at all times or he may open you up and get a kill off one of his powerful combos. godfrey doesn't seem to have a second phase change, so simply follow the game plan and he will eventually fall to your combination of safe punishes and guard counters. he is very slow moving, so if you need a moment of rest you can simply roll back or run away to create some distance. defeat him to get another talisman pouch and get access to the erdtree sanctuary site of grace. /n morgott, the omen king , is one of the main bosses in elden ring and the area boss of leyndell, royal capitol . the battle against him feels like an expert level difficulty version of the margit boss fight from way earlier in the game. melina, our maiden companion, can be summoned for this boss battle using the summon sign just outside the fog door. consider bringing her along for a little extra help. check out our boss guide to defeating morgott below: surprise! morgott was hiding in front of our eyes this entire time. he's back and better than ever with a new sword and a whole bunch of new abilities (along with some old tricks). this is not as simple of a fight as godfrey was, but with a good shield and a careful approach (and maybe some help from the melina summon) we can take him down and claim another great rune. much of the difficulty of this fight comes from morgott's unpredictability. he can move around quickly, summon a few different weapons, and he has a few fake combo enders and surprisingly long combos, making it tough to pinpoint when the right moment to punish is. during the first phase the general rule of thumb is to punish any time he uses a hammer attack, as those are the slowest and have the longest cooldown. the high leap into the air in particular leaves morgott open for 2-3 attacks afterward. as always, guard counters can also be effective assuming you have the stamina management to use them without getting guard broken. occasionally morgott will strike out with a weak attack and then raise his sword over his head in a sort of circular motion. this is a great opening to counter the weak hit, then roll dodge the heavy sword swing and punish after for a good chunk of damage. for any other attack be on your guard, since he loves to follow up most of his normal attacks with a quick dagger swipe or a step back dagger throw, which may interrupt your attempt to attack or kill you while you try to find a moment to heal. another attack to avoid is the sword rain. if you see the swords appear in the air you may be able to sneak in one attack before they start falling, but otherwise get away to avoid the initial burst of damage, then avoid the area of effect afterwards. at about half health morgott will fall to his knees and vomit, signaling the start of phase two. if you have a bleed or freeze weapon maybe try and sneak in 1-2 hits here to build the effect, but otherwise get away before he rises with his area of effect explosion attack. in phase two things become a bit more complicated. not only does he have new attacks, but his old ones have some changes as well. for example, the hammer slams now trigger an explosion shortly after impact, meaning you only have a small opening to attack afterwards without risking taking area of effect damage. the new punishable attack is his bloody sword. he will run his hand along the blade, turning it red, before either slashing or dashing in. dodge roll into him to avoid the slash and the small blood explosions that trigger afterward, then hit him 1-2 times in the back while he is regaining his posture. if he does a stutter step before slashing that usually means he will do two slashes, and if he holds the blade in a thrusting motion instead of over his head he is going to try and impale you. all of these variations can be dodged and punished in similar ways, just be aware that each has a slightly different timing and hitbox. just like phase one, do not even try to punish the other combos unless you are very confident you know what is coming. anytime he summons his light dagger or sword it usually means a rapid attack combo is coming your way. it is much safer to just block or avoid these attacks completely and wait out a more obvious and slow move. if you are really struggling with morgott the good news is you have some extra tools to fall back on. melina can be summoned in front of the boss door, providing you backup with a mix of physical attacks and ranged spells. you can also use an ash summon of your choice, though i would recommend waiting until phase two begins since that is when things really turn up. defeating morgott will get you remembrance of the omen king and morgott's great rune . you can also speak to morgott's husk in the boss arena afterward to get a little extra lore. /n the fire giant is one of the major bosses in elden ring and the area boss of the mountaintops of the giants region. he is our largest foe yet and the last obstacle between us and the forge. check out our boss guide to defeating the fire giant below: this massive boss arena comes along with a fittingly massive foe, the fearsome fire giant . this battle is a bit simple and gimmicky, but the giant's powerful attacks can make it a bit challenging as well. this battle features two phases, both of quick require you to focus on a weak spot on the giant's body. when the battle begins you will want to stay on foot, holding up your shield until the giant does his snow shoveling attack. once the snow has dispersed jump onto torrent and ride up to his feet. the giant's first weak spot is his left ankle, which you will notice is wrapped up in some primitive bandages. strike the bandage a few times to cause it to break, stunning the giant momentarily and exposing the wound underneath. continue striking the ankle, always staying slightly behind the foot to avoid the giant's frontward facing slam attacks. you will also need to look out for his fire spells and foot stomps. if he casts the slow moving fire orb you will want to run up to it to trigger it to explode, then get out of the radius before the explosion happens. if the ground begins to catch on fire you need to make sure you are not standing on top of any of the burning spots, as they will soon explode causing damage. avoid all of these attacks and keep hitting the ankle until the giant reaches about half health, at which point phase two will begin. the giant will tear off his foot and the eye on his chest will open, revealing his second weak spot. in this phase of the fight you will want to stay on torrent the entire time, constantly weaving in and out of his melee range and striking him one or two times per pass. the attack we are looking for is his body slam, which will momentarily cause him to lay on his side allowing you to strike his eye directly. while you wait for that attack there are a number of other attacks you need to avoid: if he leans back he is preparing to spit fiery rocks from the mouth on his chest. these will pepper the ground around him, but are relatively easy to see coming and avoid on torrent. try and get behind him and strike his legs. if you get too far away he will begin firing homing fireballs that deal massive damage. for this reason you will want to stay behind him and close to him as much as possible. never get underneath the giant or else he may do his body roll and crush you underneath. this also applies to being to the side of him. stay behind his legs as much as you can. if he leans forward in a sort of plank position he is going to spew fire onto the ground. just get away as fast as possible to avoid getting caught in the area of effect. in general, stay behind and close to the giant as often as possible. don't get greedy with your hits and keep an eye out for the body slam to get maximum damage on his eye. just be careful not to stay close to the eye for too long or you will give him the opportunity to execute his powerful fire breath attack. keep up the hit and runs for long enough and you will bring the fire giant down and claim his reward: the remembrance of the fire giant . /n the godskin duo is the midboss of the crumbling farum azula . this boss is a combination of two previous bosses, the godskin noble and the godskin apostle. similar to the four kings from dark souls, you need to deplete the boss health bar by defeating multiple iterations of each foe. this boss is located at the bottom of the dragon temple area. check out our boss guide to defeating the godskin duo below: godskin noble . godskin apostle . as if these guys weren't annoying enough on their own, now you get to battle them at the same time! just because these are familiar foes does not make things much easier, but the silver lining is that these are weakened versions of the bosses. you should already be at least somewhat familiar with these enemies from your past encounters, so my main advice for this new encounter is simple: cheese them (a little). there are a number of large pillars scattered around the boss arena which you can use to put distance between you and the bosses. they will crumble when attacked, and certain moves and projectiles will reach over them, but the bosses can not simply walk over them like you can giving you a massive advantage when you use them correctly. the most annoying aspect of this fight is that the two bosses will often stick close together and constantly throw projectiles at you when at a distance, but by positioning yourself around the pillar you can force them to split up and even block some of their black fireballs. this strategy allows you to create more openings to punish one boss or the other. additionally, if you have a projectile, spell, or a weapon with a medium to long range weapon art (like moonveil or sword of night and flame ) you can hit them through the pillar like they will try to do to you. like i said before, these are weakened versions of the godskin bosses, mostly when it comes to their health pools. you will notice they die very quickly, but the boss health bar is quite massive. similar to the four kings from dark souls more godskin bosses will keep spawning until you have depleted the entire bar. the good news is once one boss dies it takes some time for another to spawn. this is your chance to really lay into the other godskin boss, and this is where you need to dictate the pace of the fight most of all. your goal should be to use whatever resources necessary to burst down one of the godskin bosses, whichever once you feel less confident against in the one on one. for example, i split the two enemies up and then unleashed a rivers of blood full weapon art combo (as always, bleed is highly effective) to kill one of the bosses near the start. turn your focus to the other boss, doing as much damage as you can while you wait for them to summon. when you see them calmly and slowly raise their hand into the air they are preparing to summon their ally back, and this is your opening to unleash whatever big combo you have to burn down the second foe. in this way you should almost always be able to keep yourself in a one on one, or at least have one of the bosses incredibly weakened at all times. in my fight i had to kill four godskin bosses in total to fully deplete the health bar. the reward for defeating this army of godskin warriors is the smithing stone miner's bell bearing [4] and the ash of war: black flame tornado . rest at the newly spawned dragon temple altar site of grace and prepare to explore the rest of the dungeon. /n maliketh, the black blade is the final boss of the crumbling farum azula legacy dungeon. he is a two part boss, starting as the beast clergyman and then transforming into maliketh for phase two. check out our boss guide to defeating maliketh, the black blade below: another familiar face, the beast clergyman is the final boss of farum azula. but is this the same clergyman we met at the bestial sanctum? only one way to find out... most of his moveset consists of dashing around and throwing rocks at you, especially when you are out of his melee range. these attacks are incredibly easy to see coming (he drags his hand along the ground before throwing) and you can just dodge roll toward him to avoid the damage. this creates a good opportunity to heal as well, so just back off and bait out one of his rock throws anytime you need a sip from your flask (just like the godskin duo , you can use the pillars here as a shield as well). when you are in melee range he will do a lot of different swings and jabs with his dagger. keep an eye out for his long range forward stab, which is telegraphed by him doing a small hop then fully thrusting his dagger forward. you can dodge roll into this then get a few attacks off before he regains his composure. for the most part though our strategy will be to stand in front of him with our shield up, waiting for his long dagger combo that ends with a downward dagger thrust. he usually opens with two quick dagger slashes, then adds a third before standing up and raising his dagger into the air. this is the attack we want. if you have barricade shield activate it here, wait for the attack, then guard counter it. if you do not, you can simply dodge roll in before the dagger impact and get a few attacks in. keep a close eye on his hands though. if he thrusts his offhand into the ground instead of his dagger he is actually about to unleash an area of effect spell, so do not attempt to punish or guard counter him. instead just keep your guard up or roll through it. similarly, if he thrusts his hands into the ground and the area around him starts glowing he is about to summon a blast of rocks from the ground, which will deal damage as they burst forth, and deal damage again when they fall back to the ground. you can get one or two attacks in before the rocks emerge, but the safest bet is just to back away with your guard up. dodge the rock blasts and guard counter his slow dagger slam and you will burn down half his health bar in no time, which means it's time for... you didn't think it would be that easy did you? now the beast clergyman reveals his final form as maliketh, the black blade . he becomes much more powerful, with a whole new set of moves and two annoying debuffs, one that reduces your max health and another that damages you slowly over time, which are triggered whenever you are struck by his burning blade. just like the clergyman, maliketh loves to dash all around the battlefield, attacking from every angle possible, plus he has added a number of jumping attacks to his arsenal as well. much like the clergyman, we are just going to keep our shield up and avoid as much of this as possible, waiting out a few specific attacks that are most punishable. the main attacks we are looking for are his horizontal grounded slash and slow overhead slash, both of which offer a great opportunity to attack. you can usually bait these out by just standing around in front of maliketh, but there are a few combo paths he can follow. after the horizonal slash along the ground, he may grab his sword with both hands and swing it over his head, slamming the ground. this is the best case scenario. you can strafe to the side of him and attack 3-4 times before he regains posture. he may also chain that slash into a jumping triple slash, which you can strafe to the side of then punish when he lands. if he instead opens the combo with the overhead slash, do not attempt to punish immediately as he can chain that into a quick horizontal slash, or a spinning triple slash. these are punishable as well if you keep your guard up, but it may be easier just to back off and wait for a better opening. next, some attacks we want to avoid. anytime maliketh jumps into the air and thrusts his sword into the ground, simply get away or attack with a projectile. this looks like a great opportunity to attack, but the thrust triggers a powerful explosion about a second later you do not want to be caught in (after the explosion maliketh does a backflip before landing back on the ground. if you are in position behind him you can get one or two attacks in as he lands). additionally, he will occasionally chain one thrust into a vertical jump slash that ends with a giant flurry of slashes which will kill most players instantly if not blocked. my advice is to just get away. same goes for just about all of his jump attacks really. most of them have large areas of effect and erratic movements, so its better just to strafe away and not even try to get involved or else you may just get caught in his blender of attacks. this goes double for his sword projectiles, which he will launch out from his sword while spinning in the air. he will usually telegraph these attacks by jump up onto one of the pillars first, before launching himself into the air. his most powerful variant of this attack sees him fire off three sword projectiles with a small delay in between each one before dashing back into the ground with a massive circular swing. if you see this one coming you want to dodge roll toward him, through each of the projectiles, then dodge roll inward one last time as he comes flying back to earth to avoid the final slash. this attack is very deadly, but the dodge timing is fairly forgiving. just like before, you can use the pillars around the battlefield to create a barrier between you and maliketh and block his attacks and projectiles, but know that some of his attacks, including the aforementioned circular slash, will hit through the pillar. wait out his less dangerous attacks and slowly wear him down (or perfect the blasphemous claw parry if you are feeling confident) and you will eventually topple this formidable enemy and obtain his reward, the remembrance of the black blade . after a short cutscene you will be warped to a new, yet familiar, area /n dragonlord placidusax is an optional legend boss that can be found in the crumbling farum azula legacy dungeon. he has some similarities to lichdragon fortissax, but has his own set of dangerous abilities to contend with. check out our boss guide to finding, and defeating, dragonlord placidusax below: to find dragonlord placidusax, warp to the beside the great bridge site of grace, then go backwards through the temple where you previously battled that group of beastmen. exit the temple through the front entrance and run directly forward to the edge of the floating platform. look down and you will see some rocky platforms you can drop to. follow these rocks all the way to the bottom and jump onto the floating ruins at the very end, near the base of the tempest. inspect the ground and you will notice one of the "graves" is empty. walk up to the empty grave and you will be prompted to "lie down". hit this prompt to activate a cutscene that takes you to the dragonlord's boss arena. oh miyazaki, you just couldn't stop yourself from adding just one last giant dragon boss, huh? dragonlord placidusax is a fairly typical dragon boss, and bears a few similarities to the large dragons we were battling all around farum azula. he always starts the fight with one of his roars, which summons a series of lightning strikes on top of you. simply run out of the area of effect to dodge it, or learn the roll timing and dodge just before the strike hits. like many dragons, the ideal place to stand for this fight is to the side or behind the dragons legs. he has a fairly long tail that you can hit to deal good damage while staying out of range of all his forward face fire and claw attacks. while standing behind there are three attacks you need to watch out for: the lightning roar: same as the one he opened the fight with. each roar triggers three lightning strikes, with a short delay between each. you can attack during this sequence, but you need to move out of the strike or dodge roll between attacks to avoid it. firebreath: even when you are attacknig the tail, make sure you are watching the heads! the dragonlord will occasionally turn one of his heads around and breathe a stream of fire at you. move out of the way or just put your shield up and tank the damage. tail swipe: the dragonlord will lift his tail up into the air, then swing it along the ground. this is incredibly easy to dodge or block as long as you see it coming, but it also causes the dragonlord to spin around so you have to reposition yourself afterwards. dashing firebreath: the dragonlord dashes away, turns around, then lets loose a stream of flames directly at you. you can simply step back to avoid this, or do a wide strafe to get out of range. when facing you the dragonlord will do a few different attacks: a horizontal claw swipe that can be easily dodged by rolling into it, a vertical claw smash that causes an explosion on the ground (back away or block), or a long duration firebreath that covers the area in front of him. i would not recommend trying to punish any of these attacks because they are a bit erratic and he sometimes chains them into each other. just do your best to get behind him again and hack away at his tail or hind legs. he also has a rare but powerful lightning spear attack. he will jab the spear into the ground, wait a moment, then slam it with his claw, creating a massive expolsion that covers the battlefield. i only saw this attack once, but i recommend just getting as far away as you can and putting your shield up. at 50% health the dragonlord will float into the air and disappear, triggering phase two of the fight. start scanning the sky, looking out for an accumulation of clouds and electricity. after a short duration the dragonlord will burst out of this cloud and do a swooping attack across the ground, which you can dodge by rolling into it right as he passes over you. from here he will continue to disappear, reappear, do one attack (usually a slow claw swipe), then disappear again. you can usually land one or two hits after his attack and before he disappears again. if you stay locked on your cursor will generally instantly snap to wherever the dragon teleported to, so use this to keep track of him. the sequence will end after about three attacks, and the dragonlord will return to his normal moveset for a bit before eventually disappearing again and doing the whole thing over again. when the dragonlord reaches about 25% health he will start an ongoing lightning storm all around the arena, so you need to be even more vigilant in dodging the lightning strikes. he will also mix in an extra powerful variant of his firebreath, where the flames turn into solid beams that sweep across the battlefield. you can roll through these beams as they pass through you, or you can simply put your shield up and get far back where most of them won't reach. once the beams reside rush back in and keep up the assault. keep playing it safe and striking his tail until he falls. once the dragon dies you will be rewarded with the remembrance of the dragonlord . /n mohg, lord of blood is an optional boss in elden ring, demi-god and lord of the mohgwyn palace . he is a powerful spellcaster with a wide variety of bleed inflicting spells, as well as powerful melee attacks. he is meant to be one of the game's final challenges, and gives a great rune and remembrance upon being defeated. check out our boss guide for defeating the powerful mohg below: there are two versions of mohg that can be fought in the lands between, though one is much harder than the other. the weaker version of mohg, the omen is located in the subterranean shunning-grounds - an underground dungeon located below leyndell, royal capital . mohg, lord of blood is located in the underground region known as mohgwyn palace - the large acropolis seen far off in the distance when exploring the siofra river well. however, you can't reach it from the well - as you can only enter the palace region either from undertaking a pvp quest from varre , or finding a sending gate teleporter in the far western side of the consecrated snowfield . mohg, lord of blood is one of the toughest optional bosses in elden ring. he has powerful and far reaching physical attacks, mixed magic and physical damage, and many bleed inflicting spells, and that is before you even reach his much more powerful second phase. to prepare you will want high defense and a good 100% physical block shield. also consider some defensive talismans, like the dragoncrest shield talisman or pearldrake talisman . if you battled mohg in the subterranean shunning grounds you will already be familiar with this phase of the battle, but if not here is a little refresher: if he claws the area in front of him a small explosion will appear after a delay. wait a beat then dodge roll backwards to avoid the damage. if he reaches behind and charges up the spell the explosion will be bigger but focused directly in front of him, making it easy to side step and strike him a few time. if you are far out of melee range, he will summon a magic rune above him, reach into it, then quickly fling a wave of blood at you. you can avoid this by simply rolling toward the blood as it is flying toward you. if he reaches into that same magic rune and holds his hand there for a second or two he is about to summon his blood rain. you can punish this attack with one or two hits from behind, but once the blood actually starts raining you need to step back to avoid getting caught in the damage cone. almost all of mohg's melee combos are three hits long, so make sure you aren't trying to punish or guard counter until the very end of the sequence. be even more careful of the ground stab, which has a second hitbox when he pulls the spear out of the ground. the most punishable attacks are the overhead slam and forward thrust. both of these can be dodged by simply rolling into him before the weapon makes impact, allowing for a few hits before he will follow up. upon taking 15-20% of his health in damage, mohg will thrust his spear into the air and do a diagonal slash which can be avoid by simply strafing to his offhand side or behind. even if you avoid this attack a blood ring will appear around your character. he will do this each time he loses 15-20% of his health, until you have three rings on you. at this point he will activate the rings, causing three instances of highly damaging bleed that restore mohg's health. you basically need to chug flasks between the instances of bleed to survive, then get ready for phase two against the newly refreshed mohg. even if you don't have the damage or execution required to kill mohg in phase one it is still a good idea to try and maximize your phase one damage because that will mean he starts with less health in phase two, meaning less time you have to phase this hellish foe. in phase two mohg grows wings, his attacks gain even more bleed and magic damage properties, and he starts mixing in some new attacks (and of course, mohg's shackle will no longer stun him). his base moveset remains mostly the same, except now his melee swings fling blood that deals extra damage and he likes to fly around in the air when casting spells. if you are using a shield you just have to eat this damage and stay on top of health management between his combos. he seems to be a bit more unrelenting here as well, so it will be harder to create distance and heal when needed. some new additions: the thrust attack now has a second instance of damage where mohg twirls the spear to fling blood, and the explosion after the ground stab is bigger and even more damaging, so strafe around and get away from it by any means necessary. he also likes to mix in a long range, multi-hit thrust attack when you are far away, which he telegraphs by leaning back with both hands on his weapon, slightly flapping his wings, then dashing forward. it seems best to dodge to the side when you see this one coming. same goes for his uppercut into ground slam, which ends in a similar explosion to the ground stab. it is tempting to try and punish, but it is best to just stay back. so that all sounds pretty dangerous, so when do you hit him? like usual, the move is to wait for the overhead slam attacks. if you stand outside his melee range you can tempt him into two highly punishable attacks: his long range slam where he holds his spear by the very end and slams it down in front of him. dodge roll forward and you can get in a few easy hits. there is another variation of his where he jumps into the air before slamming the spear down, similar concept, similarly punishable. the other is his flying uppercut into thrust. this is the thrust that does not result in a ground stab explosion. dodge into him as he comes down to ground level and you can get in some more free attacks. and of course, you can still get in a hit or two when he casts the blood rain or claw explosion, if you are quick enough to avoid the hitboxes. all in all, it's a hard fight but one that can be simplified with the right approach. never stay in his melee range too long or you may just get caught in his blender of melee attacks and die to stray bleed damage. instead run away and bait out his slower attacks for slow building damage (funny enough, you will notice bleed weapons work really well on him). defeat mohg and you will be rewarded with the remembrance of the blood lord and mohg's great rune . /n loretta, knight of the haligtree , is the area boss of the optional miquella's haligtree dungeon and the final barrier blocking you from getting into elphael, brace of the haligtree . she is a repeat of the area boss from caria manor and uses a mix of powerful melee attacks and tricky spells. loretta's arena is found at the end of the haligtree town plaza site of grace, but there is a nearby elevator shortcut that will take you back to the haligtree town site of grace as well. check out our boss guide to defeating loretta below. deja vu! loretta from the caria manor is back and stronger than ever, this time under the title loretta, knight of the haligtree . she uses a combination of powerful halberd swings and magic spells, so equip your best magic resist shield and talismans and get ready to execute some guard counters! this is a very straightforward fight. loretta will bounce between running at you and attempting various melee attacks and backing off to shoot off a few magic spells. her most common spell seems to be the homing swords. whenever she unleashes this one just stand back and wait for them to fly, then dodge roll to the side before the moment of impact. this is true for most of the spells, but one to watch for is her magic bow and arrow spell. if you rush toward her as she is charging it up then roll through you can get in 1-2 attacks as she is recovering. when it comes to melee attacks her swings are very slow and easy to dodge, but the combos are deceptive. most of them can be guard countered, but you will likely take a hit from her in return. the ones to watch out for are the sweep into powerful overhead swing (her horse will rear up onto its back legs and whinny) and the magic double slash (telegraphed by the tip of her halberd glowing blue). you can anticipate and roll through both of these, then get in multiple attacks during the cooldown period afterwards. at about half health she will enchant herself with magic, making all of her spells and attacks stronger, but it doesn't really change the fight at all other than you may take some more damage. keep an eye out for the rapid fire spells she shoots out of the handle of her halberd (roll towards her to get into melee range which causes her to stop) and be careful of the slight variation on the magic halberd slash, which has some extra swings and a new slam at the end (this seems to be avoidable by just sticking close to her). as long as you equipped a few good resist items you should be able to hold out for quite awhile, so just be patient, dodge carefully, and capitalize anytime she does one of her many slow attacks. upon defeating her you will be rewarded loretta's mastery and loretta's war sickle , and unlock access to the haligtree promenade site of grace. /n malenia, blade of miquella , is the area boss of elphael, brace of the haligtree . she is, by most accounts, the most difficult boss in elden ring, and quite possibly the most difficult boss in any of the soulsborne titles. her powerful attacks, unrelenting combos, and unique boss mechanic make her a fearful foe that you should not face until you have defeated all of elden ring's other challenges. check out our boss guide to defeating malenia below: malenia is the final boss of a secret legacy dungeon called miquella's haligtree , wherin lies elphael, brace of the haligtree . this dungeon can only be accessed in the final northern region known as the consecrated snowfield . to reach the snowfield region, you need a secret medallion to use at the grand lift of rold. the two halves are given by an albinauric named albus that is disguised as a barrel in the albinauric village in western liurnia under the large mountain. the other half can be found in the mountaintops of the giants , on the far northwestern side after clearing the large and imposing castle sol . at last we have arrived, the boss of the haligtree: malenia, blade of miquella , quite possibly fromsoft's most devious invention yet. malenia has all the typical trappings of a difficult boss (high damage, oppressive attack pattern, tricky combos), but what truly sets her apart is her unique lifesteal mechanic that gives her health back on every hit, even when you block. this means you can't just hide behind your shield and wait for an opening, or else she will steal back every bit of damage you deal. this can turn the battle into a long, drawn out war of attrition, but the better approach is to simply damage race her with the most powerful weapon you can find. ready? okay. time to fight. first thing to note is that malenia does not really zip across the battlefield very often. she doesn't have any projectile attacks so if you never get close to her she will likely just slow walk towards you until you approach. you can use this to your advantage any time you need to heal or rest for a second. when you do approach it is important to identify which of her attacks are easily punished, so here are some things to look out for: her basic sword attacks should just be avoided or blocked. she will usually execute two to three wide swings in a row, then end with a jumping slam attack or sweeping kick that deals massive stamina damage on shield. there is an opportunity to guard counter here, but i would advise against it due to the unpredictability or her combos. when you see her long blade slide backwards up her hand she is about to do a short dash followed by a multi-hit combo. i recommend just blocking the first three hits, then rolling toward her to avoid the fourth. from here she can extend the combo into a jumping slam or a delayed wide swing. both are punishable, but you need to read her movements quick to decide which one she is preparing for (jump vs. stay on ground). when you see her do a spinning jump she is about to let loose one of her kicks. do not block this attack or you may be guard broken. instead roll toward her and immediately try to punish with a few hits. move quick though! if you wait too long she will extend into a different combo finisher which can catch you off guard. if she pulls her blade back, but still has it pointed towards you she is about to do a fast, long range thrust. this is one of the easiest moves to punish, simply roll away when she dashes in, then hit her two or three times as she is regaining her posture (there is an alternate version of this where she jumps into the air before dashing, but the dodge and punish are the same). however, if she pulls her blade back with it pointed up and away from her she is about to do a short range uppercut followed by an aerial slam. this is also highly punishable, simply roll into the initial uppercut, then strafe around her to avoid the slam. hit her two or three times in the back. finally, if she gets into her stance with the blade pointed horizontally (but not pointed at you) she is about to dash in with a powerful double slash. dodge in, then strafe to avoid the second attack before punishing. if she instead pulls her empty back she is about to do one of her most deadly moves, the dash grab. roll away immediately when she starts moving to avoid getting grabbed. this attack deals massive damage, but just like the other dashes it is punishable with two or three hits as long as yout time your dodge properly. the one attack we absolutely do not want to see is her waterfowl dance. this is the move we need the barricade shield for. she signals this move by lifting into the air and curling up into a sort of fetal position for a moment, before flying toward you with a flurry of slashes. you will want to activate barricade as soon as you see her float and block the entire first volley of attacks. after this she will pause, unleash another set of attacks, then pause again, and unleash another set of attacks followed by one final area slash. to avoid the second and third flurries you need to dodge roll into her as she begins the next set of slashes. this is pretty difficult to do, but with a few attempts you can get the timing down consistently. make sure you do not run in to punish her until after the final area slash has happened. with all of the above knowledge in mind, your job is to now win the battle of attrition. take as few hits as possible and make sure you are punishing more than she is getting back via blocked attacks. you can accelerate this process using one of the aforementioned weapons. for example, using rivers of blood you can execute 3-5 hit combos from outside of melee range, dealing massive damage and bleed. you will still need to keep an eye out for her dash attacks and flurry, but your high damage output will mean a quicker fight and less opportunities for her to heal. just make sure you have enough mind or fp flasks to keep up the assault. with enough practice and determination you will become an expert at defeating malenia. unfortunately, this is only the beginning.... yep, of course there is a second phase to this fight. as if that first phase wasn't hard enough now we have to face a faster, more aggressive malenia with stronger attacks. oh, and of course she can inflict scarlet rot as well. she will always open the battle with the same attack, an aerial dive that leads into a giant area of effect blast that inflicts scarlet rot. you have a moment to drink one flask and put your guard up before she will dive. as soon as you see her make her move roll toward her, then run away as fast as you can to avoid the blast. you will probably get hit at least once, but that is no issue as long as you aren't too close to the center of the blast. a giant flower will bloom around her, dealing continuous rot to anyone who stands too close. this is a great opportunity to heal up or eat any damage bonus items you might have, since she won't do any other attacks while the flower is up. as soon as the flower begins to fade run in and start attacking. you should be able to get three or four hits before she reacts, usually with a spinning kick. if you see the kick coming you can roll in and get in another hit or two, but she likes to follow it up with a jump into slam attack, which now leaves a delayed explosion on the ground that will prevent the usual punish. from here things get very messy. her combos have changed slightly and she is far more aggressive than she was in phase one. it is very easy to simply get caught up on her blender of attacks and die before you even get to play. because of this you aren't likely to get much time to learn the new movements before she kills you. instead i recommend a simpler strategy: run away! malenia is faster than you, but if you keep running away (while dodging any dashes she might do) you can eventually bait her into doing one of the bad attacks listed below. the main ones we want to see are her simple aerial dash attacks. she will leap high into the air, hover for a moment, then dash toward you with an easily dodged attack you can punish with two or three back attacks. however, if she points the sword toward you while in the air she is going to land and pivot before immediately executing another grounded dash attack. this is easy to dodge as long as you see it coming, and can be punished just as easily as any other dash. another easy punish is her doppelganger attack. she will float high into the air, then send down a flurry of doppelgangers who will attack one by one. the doppelgangers will attack about five times (these do not lifesteal, so you can simply block with barricade) before malenia herself flies toward you with a thrust attack. this attack can be punished similarly to the grounded dash, but you need to be careful because she will occasionally chain this directly into a second dash attack, which can also be easily dodge rolled before punishing. finally, she will occasionally repeat blooming flower attack from the start of the battle. this is probably the best attack to see because it is incredibly slow and easy to punish, meaning you can take a second to heal, buff up, then hit her with everything you've got. similar to phase one, long ranged weapon abilities like the ones on moonveil or sword of night and flame are invaluable here. they let you punish the attacks i've mentioned above without ever really putting yourself in real danger. all you really need is enough patience and luck to burn her down before she catches you with her enhanced waterfowl dance or grab attack. your reward for beating malenia is the remembrance of the rot goddess (which lets you craft her incredible sword), malenia's great rune , and the satisfaction that you have overcome fromsoft's most devilish challenge yet. congratulations! /n sir gideon ofnir, the all-knowing is the first boss found in the leyndell, ashen capital area. he is a powerful humanoid enemy who uses spells stolen from previous bosses, but his small health pool makes him relatively easy. check out our boss guide to defeating sir gideon below: oh sir gideon , not you too. ah well, looks like we will have to kill our old pal to progress. thankfully he is a bit of a glass cannon who can be burst down with just a few good combos. sir gideon makes good on his "all-knowing" title with his moveset, which is a combination of abilities stolen from all of the game's major bosses. various spells from renalla, blood magic from mohg, scarlet aeonia from malenia, rykard's rancor, and so on. most of these spells deal massive damage, so be on your guard especially when it comes to renalla's soul spears. because most of these attacks are projectiles you can stand behind the pillars near the middle of the room as a barrier to block them. the one spell you do need to look out for is law of causality, the glowing ring buff he occasionally places on himself. if you hit him too many times while he has this buff active it will explode and deal massive damage. the good news is gideon has all the same weaknesses as any humanoid enemy. he can be strafed and backstab fairly easily. he can be easily stunlocked with a fast weapon. i was able to kill him in a flash using the rivers of blood weapon art which he wasn't quick enough to get out of. he died so fast i almost expected there to be a phase two, but alas there is not. the reward for defeating gideon is the scepter of the all-knowing and the all-knowing armor set . the erdtree sanctuary site of grace will appear again, allowing you to rest and level up if needed. /n hoarah loux, warrior (also known as the true form of godfrey, first elden lord, is the second to last fight in leyndell, ashen capital at the end of the game, and guards the entrance to the erdtree itself. he has two major phases which ramp up the difficulty! check out our boss guide to defeating godfrey and hoarah loux below: this is more or less the same godfrey, first elden lord boss battle we experienced our first time through leyndell, and just like that version of godfrey this one is highly susceptible to guard counter abuse. as you enter the battle, he almost always opens with just jumping axe throw. simply roll backwards to avoid the axe impact, then you can sneak in 2-3 attack on godfrey when he lands and picks it back up. from here you just want to stay near godfrey with your shield up at pretty much all times. we want to wait out one of his many slow swinging attacks so we can guard counter him into a topple. in general there rule is that is he slams his axe into the ground rather than sweeping it across the ground, the combo is over. he also like to telegraph when his big combo enders are coming by delaying his swing extra long or spinning the axe over his head. these are the moments where you can toss in a guard counter, but if your defense and poise are high enough you can sometimes hit multiple guard counters across one of his combos and just power through the damage. after a topple you have just enough time to drink a flask before executing the critical attack, so make sure to heal up! there are exceptions to the aforementioned rule though. if he opens his combo with the downward axe slam, he is about to follow it with an uppercut. after his stomp he frequently combos into a grounded axe slam which leads into a massive area of effect slam when he steps on the axe and digs it into the ground. the wind up and cooldown of this attack are fairly slow, so try and sneak in an attack or two between your guards. speaking of the stomp, this is one of his most favored attacks, and it is also highly punishable. anytime you see him go for the stomp you can simply roll through the attack and hit him 2-3 times in the back while he recovers. at 75% health godfrey will real back on one foot and charge up for his second phase where his attacks become stronger, particularly his stomp which now spreads across the entire boss arena. however none of that will matter if you punish godfrey when he is powering up. pay close attention to his health, and as soon as you see him rear back to change phases unleash everything you have on him. it is actually surprisingly easy to get 4-5 hits on him while he is reared back, giving plenty of time to burn the next 25% of his health (especially if you have bleed or freeze). "wait, why only 25%?" you may be wondering. well turns out our friend godfrey has one more secret hiding up his sleeve, his final form... godfrey tosses his weapons and armor aside to tear you apart with his bare hands in his final form as hoarah loux, warrior . hoarah loux is a much simpler fight in that he has far fewer moves than godfrey, but he uses them more relentlessly which makes it hard to find an opening. complicating things even further are hoarah loux's multiple grabs, which deal massive damage and need to be dodged rather than blocked. this fight is entirely about pattern recognition, learning the dodge timings for the grabs, and capitalizing on the few punish opportunities you get. the grabs you need to look out for are: hoarah loux swings his right arm around, then pauses for a moment before doing an uppercut motion to grab you then slam you into the ground. this one can be avoided by simply strafing around and rolling in at the moment of the grab. if you successfully roll through you can get 2-3 attacks on his back afterwards. hoarah loux crosses his arms in a sort of x, before dashing forward and clawing you with both hands. he launches you into the air, then slams you to the ground for big damage. again, you need to perfect the dodge timing and roll into the attack just before he claws you. this one is hard to punish because he usually slides far past you after, but it is a good chance to heal. hoarah loux raises both hands high into the air, before leaning down and scooping you into the air with both hands. this one has pretty deceptive timing, but as usual strafe around while you wait for the grab motion then roll through it and strike him in the back. this is the one he almost always opens the fight with. beyond the grabs, another move to keep an eye out for is the roar, which results in knockback and always chains into a follow up attack. two of these are jumping slam attacks, one low and one high. the low jump can be easily dodged by rolling in as he lands, then you can attack him 2-3 times as he stands up. the high jump can be dodged in a similar way, but hoarah loux follows it up with two earthquakes that hits the area around him. you can dodge through these quakes or jump over them if you have good timing, then maybe land 1-2 attacks as he stands up. he still employs the same stomp attack from phase one, but it is trickier this time around because he will often chain it into a second kick, spinning kick, or punch attack. if you see the stomp coming employ the same strafe and dodge strategy to get behind hoarah loux, but wait to see if he is going to chain it into a combo before you try and attack him. a lot of times there won't be any opening at all before he moves into his next attack, so stay on your toes! he rounds out his moveset with a number of different punch and kick combos, all of which deal moderate damage. i would recommend just rolling away or blocking all of these, as it is much easier to just wait out one of his slower attacks instead of trying to punish these. the one of these that is highly punishable is his two handed hammer fist. when you seem his raise his hands over his head and slam both down into the ground, simply strafe and roll around to get a few attacks on his back. he has one particularly long combo which he telegraphs by slowing raising one of his open hands behind his head as if he is about to uppercut, but instead lets loose a series of fast swipes. i recommend just backing away immediately and not even trying to block or dodge this one. at 25% health hoarah loux will do the same charging up animation as godfrey, leaving himself wide open for a major punish before he enters his final phase. just like godfrey this phase features most of the same attacks, just with new versions and wider ranges. rinse and repeat the same strategies we used in the first phase to finish this battle out and earn your reward, the remembrance of hoarah loux , the elden throne site of grace, and access to elden ring's final boss. /n radagon of the golden order (also known as the elden beast ) is the final boss fight in elden ring, taking place inside the erdtree at leyndell, ashen capital , and is your final fight - and a tough one at that. check out our boss guide to defeating radagon below: finally we have arrived, face to face with the famous radagon we have heard so much about. radagon is yet another powerful humanoid enemy, similar to godfrey in that he can be guard countered pretty heavily. however, his constant output of holy damage makes things a little more complicated, so you will need to keep tabs on your health and stamina at all times to avoid being beaten by one of his explosive attacks. most of radagon's movesets is made up of different mace swings, with a few magic spells mixed in for good measure. much like godfrey, our plan is to stay up in his face, shield up (barricade shield if you've got it), as much as possible to keep him swinging his mace and not throwing spells around. the first thing to note is that radagon stands motionless for the first 10-15 seconds of the fight. as soon as you spawn in immediately run at him and you can get in 3-4 attacks before he does anything. once the sight beings, here are a few attacks to look for: double mace swing (side to side) followed by an overhead slam. easy to block or dodge through, then punish with 2-3 attacks or a guard counter. occasionally follows this with a delayed fourth swing, which you can also guard counter after countering the third. diagonal swing, followed by a 360 swing. block or dodge, easy to guard counter as well. 360 swing spin swing into overhead slam. radagon spins around before the first hit, then charges up a holy mace slam. again, dodge roll as the attack comes in or block and guard counter the second hit. overhead holy slam. charges his mace with holy energy before slamming down. follows this immediately with a second slam or an uppercut. both are easily guard countered though you will eat some holy damage. uppercut into holy slam. swings mace up before grabbing with both hands and slamming it down. another easy guard counter if you don't mind the holy damage, or just strafe and dodge behind him. there is also a variant of this that is slower and both swings are holy charged. it is punishable in the same way. lightning bolt slam. after some of his combos radagon will leap into the air and summon a lightning bolt, which he then slams into the ground. this move looks punishable, but shortly after the lightning bolt will dissipate, causing damage from the ground around it. back away from the bolt as fast as you can. another highly punishable attack is his area of effect holy swing. he will lift up his foot and swing his mace back behind his head, charging it with holy energy, before doing a horizontal swing that causes the ground in front of him to start glowing, before exploding and dealing damage to you if you stand on it. thankfully you can just strafe around him then roll through the swing to dodge it, then hit him 3-4 times in the back while he recovers his posture. just like godfrey, radagon also has a stomp. one is a normal melee attack that pushes back, and another inflicts holy damage in a large area around him. if you see him lift his foot up to stomp and it begins glowing gold i recommend just guarding it. he will almost always follow this up by leaping into the air, before slamming back into the ground with a holy explosion. by rolling in just as he's about to hit the ground you can get behind him and sneak in 2-3 attacks as he is standing back up. if you get too far from him he will choose a few different attacks. he will jump and throw a lightning bolt, which explodes a few moments later. he will throw out a quick blast of holy energy that does a small amount of damage. or he can do a long range dash attack. the dash attack is the best case scenario, as you can dodge through and run up and attack him while he regains composure, but for the most part i just recommend staying close to him as much as possible. in one of his more intimidating attacks, radagon will slowly float above the ground, mace raised towards the sky, then he will fall back to earth and slam the mace into the ground, causing a burst of holy damage from the ground around him. he follows this with another quick slam before rising into the air again, then coming back down with a third and final smash. because of how overly dramatic the slams are they are incredibly easy to see coming and dodge. stay close to him, strafe around, and simply dodge through each of the slams. hit him in the back after the final slam for some free damage. when his missing arm begins to glow golden he is about to do his dashing grab attack, which deals massive damage if he snatches you. just like hoarah loux's grab attacks this one cannot be guarded, so you need to pay attention to the dash timing and dodge through it when he lunges forward to grab you. you can also avoid this attack by simply backing far away, but it is better to stay close and strafe around him. this will frequently cause him to lose tracking on you then dash in the wrong direction, leading to a free punish for you. finally, he has another variant of his high jumping slam where he sort of dashing through the air rather than jumping straight up. when he slams the ground after this attack it will result in an explosion of holy damage around him a few moments later, so be sure to step out of the glowing area on the ground. at about half health radagon will begin mixing teleports in between his attacks. he disappears then reappears a moment later, causing a burst of holy damage wherever he appears. this can make certain punishes less reliable as his teleport can be near instant, letting him avoid guard counters instantly. from this point i would stop countering and try to rely more on basic swing punishes for a little extra safety. keep up the punishes between teleports until you finally take him down. use his long death animation to heal up because we aren't done yet. finally the true final boss is revealed, the mysterious elden beast . he bears a resemblance to some of the large enemies we have encountered through the game, particularly astel, naturalborn of the void, but with a giant sword and full arsenal of powerful holy spells. thankfully the elden beast is pretty easy as far as final bosses go, so take a deep breath and get ready to wrap this game up! much like the dragon enemies we have battled in the past the best place to stand when attacking the elden beast is in its side, near the back legs. our basic strategy should be to try and bait the elden beast to do one of its slow, easily avoided melee attacks, then rush in and get as many attacks to its belly as you can before it swims away. thankfully the beast's sword swings are incredibly obvious and slow, so you can either put up your shield and simply block them, or just roll through to get to a closer position. another melee attack it likes to do is an arm thrust. the beast will summon a ball of light into its offhand, then thrust it forward towards you. like the sword swings, this attack is highly telegraphed and easily avoided by just rolling through the orb as it comes toward you. this is another great opportunity to take a few swings at the boss's belly. if the beast's mouth starts leaking flames you want to strafe and run away as fast as possible to avoid getting caught in the large area of effect fire breath. if you can move quickly enough to get behind the beast you can avoid it entirely. this is one of the beasts most damaging attacks, i wouldn't recommend trying to shield up and go toe to toe with it. the beast also has a few different perfume attacks, reminiscent of the ones astel used in his fight. he can spread the perfume in a forward line, or use it to create a wall in front of him. with both of these options simply step away from the perfume before it explodes to avoid the damage. the third perfume attack is a slam. the beast will summon a cloud of perfume in its offhand, then smack the ground to trigger an explosion. the best option here is just to roll away, then run back in for more attacks once the perfume fades. for the beast's final perfume attack, it will turn away from you and summon a giant cloud of perfume as it swims away. the perfume will hang in the air for a moment, then a golden flash will cause it to explode, dealing massive holy damage to you if you stand to close. the best strategy here is just to get away as soon as you see the cloud of perfume appear. the beast takes a moment to regain its composure after the explosion, so use that time to get back into attack range. perhaps the most dangerous melee attack is the beast's sword thrust, which it telegraphs by rearing back and grabbing the handle of the sword with both hands. it will point the blade toward the ground, then stick it into the ground, causing a massive explosion after 2-3 seconds. this is another instance where you will want to simply back away as quick as you can. when it gets far enough away the beast will choose between a few different attacks. one is a long range sword projectile, similar to the one maliketh used. just like maliketh's, these are easily dodged by just dodging toward the beast before the blades hit you. this will also let you quickly close the gap between you and the boss. another option is what i will refer to as the "ring" attack. the beast's body will glow and it will float into the air, summoning a golden ring in the sky. immediately look at the ground and you will soon see a golden ring forming around you as well. as it starts closing in on you run toward the edge. you want to jump over the ring and get outside the glowing circle before it explodes, dealing big damage. the most annoying attacks of all are the beast's two holy spells, which it will not hesitate to use whether you are close or far away. for one, it will run its hand along its sword, gathering holy energy in its hand before letting it loose. this ball of energy will chase you around the battlefield, letting off bits of holy shrapnel that deal small amount of damage. it will follow you for about 15-20 seconds before exploding. thankfully the shrapnel damage doesn't stun, so you can heal through it if needed. the best strategy here is just to keep moving away from the ball of energy, and keep dodging whatever other attacks the beast throws at you in the meantime. the other spell is similar, but far more dangerous. the beast's entire body will glow and it will spread out its wings, letting a bunch of holy missiles out of its back. these missiles will fly high into the sky, then come raining down on you all at once. if you stand in one spot the barrage will tear you apart in seconds, so just start running left or right to avoid the arrow rain, which thankfully only lasts about 5 seconds. the beast has a large healthpool, but if you stay on top of it and keep the attacks coming you will eventually take it down. your prize for defeating the final boss is the elden remembrance and a whole lotta runes. afterwards you will be deposited back to the stone platform where you battled radagon. approach his corpse to trigger the game's final cutscene and see your ending. congratulations on completing elden ring, time to gear up for journey 2. /n elden beast is the final boss of the

elden ring is an open world action rpg from from software. as a tarnished, it is your destiny to explore the lands between and become an elden lord. elden ring was released on february 24, 2022. this page covers the basic mechanics of elden ring, including creating your character, how combat and exploration works, how to level up, and more. other helpful pages: essential tips and tricks things to do first things elden ring doesn’t tell you walkthrough overviews for regions and legacy dungeons controls how to guides elden ring’s backstory (some of which was built by writer george r. martin), is intentionally shrouded in mystery and intrigue. a distant place known as the lands between was once ruled over by queen marika and her offspring, and they drew their powers from the mighty erdtree and a golden order known as the elden ring. however, things quickly came to ruin as a secret plot was enacted, and mysterious agents stole the rune of death, and killed one of marika’s children - godwyn the golden. these events caused queen marika to disappear, and in her absence the demigod children waged war upon one another, but no victor emerged, causing the lands between to crumble under never-ending conflict, and the elden ring and the golden order it upheld to become shattered. though the details remain elusive, it will be up to you to hunt them down as one of the tarnished - a people long since driven from the lands between. only you can stop the demigods, retrieve the great runes they carry, and reunite them to become an elden lord. how you decide to go about this, and which alliances you may forge or break along the way. much of elden ring’s lore won’t be told to you outright, and you’ll have to piece together clues from items, characters you meet, places you discover, and bosses you defeat. video - which class is best for you? upon creating a new character in elden ring, you’ll be given a wide range of cosmetic options to choose from in how your character looks. none of these cosmetic options - age, body type, physique, and voice - will affect the gameplay, and you can choose from presets, add facial features, hair styles, and tattoos - even eyepatches. note that you will have the opportunity later in the game to completely change how your character looks, free of charge. this screen will also allow you to choose your character’s starting class. you can think of this as a base origin for your character - an archetype to guide you in a particular playstyle or direction, but it is by no means set in stone. each starting class excels in a single attribute - or a better spread, and can help you define what kind of tarnished you want to be: a tried and true heavily armored fighter, a focused sorcerer, or one who is at home swinging swords and invoking faith incantations alike. the full list includes: the vagabond - "a knight exiled from their homeland to wander. a solid, armor-clad origin.” excels at high starting health, and armed with a halberd and sword the warrior - "a twinblade-wielding warrior from a nomadic tribe. an origin of exceptional technique.” excels at high dextrous ability alongside formidable stamina, and armed with twin scimitars. the hero - "a stalwart hero, at home with a battleaxe, descended from a badlands chieftain.” excels at a high starting strength, and armed with a powerful axe. the bandit - "a dangerous bandit who strikes for weak points. excels at ranged combat with bows.” excels at a high arcane for luck and discovery, alongside their strong dexterity, and is armed with a knife and buckler for easy parrying. the astrologer - "a scholar who rates fate in the stars. heir to the school of glintstone sorcery." excels at high intelligence and near equally high mind for a strong pool of fp, and is armed with a staff and basic sword. the prophet - "a seer ostracized for inauspicious prophecies. well-versed in healing incantations." excels at high faith alongside excellent mind to compliment their magic pool, and is armed with a short spear. the samurai - "a capable fighter from the distant land of reeds. handy with katana and longbows." excels at extremely high dexterity, and is armed with a longbow and uchigatana that inflicts bleed. the prisoner - "a prisoner bound in an iron mask. studied in glintstone sorcery, having lived among the elite prior to sentencing." balances high dexterity and intelligence for casting spells and swinging their rapier. the confessor - "a church spy adept at covert operations. equally adept with a sword as they are with their incantations." enjoys a near equal spread of faith, mind, dexterity, and strength to bolster melee combat with holy incantations. the wretch - "a poor, purposeless sod, naked as they day they were born. a nice club is all they have." excels at nothing, with the potential to be good at anything as they start with a clean spread of attributes, but only starts with a basic club. be sure to view a more detailed breakdown of every starting class here with our guide. like the dark souls series before it, elden ring is focused on pitting you against challenging encounters, and you’ll need to approach every fight carefully - whether it’s a group of hungry wolves or one very imposing knight. there’s no easy way around this, and you should expect to spend a fair amount of time dying to your opponents - but as long as you learn from these fights, and start to anticipate their attack patterns and traps, you can eventually emerge victorious. if you feel like you're hitting a wall, you’re also encouraged to keep exploring elsewhere in the lands between. certain encounters are more difficult than others, meaning there’s always somewhere else to go to hone your skills, find new items, and level up until you feel ready for another round. exploration is just as important as combat in elden ring, because you’ll often find items everywhere you look that can be helpful. for those new to the series, it’s highly recommended to enter the optional tutorial dungeon at the start of the game, as it will give you an excellent primer on how different attack styles work: light attacks will be your bread and butter if you choose to engage in melee, and each weapon has its own style and chain attacks - and this includes jumping and dashing attacks as well. strong attacks use up much more stamina, but can devastate enemies or knock them off their guard - even more so when used as a jumping strong attack. dodging is crucial to avoiding incoming attacks - even huge crushing blows from giants - due to the limited invulnerability you receive during the dodge animation. lighter armor means faster and farther rolls, while having your equipment load over a certain threshold will make your rolls slower and less effective - passing 100% you’ll be unable to roll entirely. shield parries can instantly open up an attacker to become vulnerable to a critical strike - but not all enemies are susceptible, and the window is very slim, making it hard to land on unpredictable opponents guard counters are a safer option to retaliate against a strike, allowing you to soak a blow with your shield and strike back with a strong attack that doesn’t rely on a short window of opportunity. when combined with a shield that absorbs 100% of incoming physical damage, you can brave many attacks and repay them with massive damage that can often break their stance - but you’ll need to ensure the incoming attack is not part of a chain, or you’ll become vulnerable when launching your counter. remember that every enemy - and your own character - has a “super armor” value that is similar to sekiro’s posture system. in elden ring, the super armor isn’t displayed, but repeated attacks will slowly erode an opponent’s armor. fighters will begin to regenerate their super armor if the offensive is not kept up, though enemies you face - especially bosses - regenerate at a much slower rate. deal enough damage (even if it’s blocked), and you can eventually break the super armor to render them susceptible to a critical strike! bigger weapons tend to deal more damage to super armor - as does jumping strong attacks and guard counters. if swords and spears aren’t your style, elden ring boasts a number of different spells to wield. you’ll have to “equip” a certain number of spells at a time when resting at a site of grace using memory slots, but spells can fulfill a wide variety of roles from offense to defense and buffs. some spells can even summon magical weapons to strike down in place of physical ones, letting you enjoy the benefits of a melee fighter without having to invest in strength or dexterity. however, you must have a staff or catalyst equipped in your hand to cast spells - and you can freely slice with a weapon in one hand while prepping spells in the other. in elden ring, certain spells can be charged by holding down the cast button to increase their effects - but the cost will stay the same. other spells can be cast while moving, or used near-instantly after performing other actions for quick combo strikes. some can even be chain-casted, allowing you to fire multiple salvos of magical attacks so long as you have the stamina to keep things rolling. aside from swords and spells, elden ring also allows you to utilize a variety of bows and crossbows to deal damage at range. ammo can come in many forms, and can even be crafted to provide effects like bleed, fire, and sleep - and can be helpful for picking off targets before they get close enough to cause trouble. bows can be quickly swapped to be held in both hands, and you can either lock onto a target for rapid fire hits, or aim manually by holding down the left bumper, and choosing between two ammo types to snipe with. this can even be done on horseback, but you’ll need to orient torrent towards your foes, or you’ll likely miss your mark. crossbows can also be wielded with less focus on dexterity than bows, and have the added bonus of being able to be wielded in one hand. to compensate, they have to be manually loaded before each shot, and don’t scale with your attributes - but they can prove very useful for dealing ranged damage in the heat of battle. just as important as fighting is discovery, and elden ring has plenty of it. as you rest at the various sites of grace to replenish your health and recharge your flasks, you may spot the glimmering wisps of gold pointing off in the direction of your next big task. this usually comes in the form of the large legacy dungeons in which the demigods of elden ring reside, but that doesn’t mean you need to head right for them. it’s often best to fully explore the region and find the various map fragments that comprise the area before trying to take on the main attraction of each region, as you’ll find countless points of interest worth checking out that can help you in the long run. this can include some of the following: ruins and encampments where various enemy soldiers are entrenched, and often guard chests of loot mini dungeons, some easily missed, others with clues to point the way - and each contains an assortment of enemies and its own mini-boss protecting valuable treasure nomadic merchants found in odd corners of the world resting by bonfires that can sell unique items and hints gusting vortexes known as spiritsprings that allow you to use torrent to leap up huge cliffs in a single bound to bypass chokepoints and explore new areas portals that lie forgotten in ruins that can transport you to unknown destinations - often one-way trips, to discover entirely new regions roaming field bosses that can be found in every region, guarding special areas or appearing only in the dead of night to strike you down mysterious little teardrop scarabs that scuttle away with balls of treasure you must race down and kill to claim their riches enigmatic characters that may have questlines of their own that you can participate in or ignore, and can repeatedly show up in new regions as you help advance their story. magical keys, cooking recipes, and enhancements for your flasks that are hidden all over the place. when you first start your adventure in elden ring, you’ll gain runes from defeating enemies, or even crushing glowing skulls on the ground to loot golden runes, but won’t have a way to spend them. you’ll need to begin exploring the open world, and activate at least three sites of grace in limgrave’s overworld and then rest before the mysterious finger maiden melina will appear before you, offering an accord. at his point, she’ll let you exchange runes to level up your attributes, and the more you level up, the more it will cost. just be wary - as dying will cause you to drop all your runes where you fell, and if you die on the way to get them back, they’ll be lost forever. luckily, the golden runes you can find on bodies or by crushing glowing skulls can be stockpiled until its time to purchase something from a merchant or level up, at which point you should use them. torrent is your trusty steed that will be your main mode of transportation for your entire adventure. he can be summoned with a special item, and it's highly recommended to place this item in your pouch to quickly access torrent by holding down y and pressing a d-pad button. you can also quickly dismount by pressing the crouch button, and doing so while riding will let you perform a leap which you can chain into an attack on unsuspecting enemies. torrent moves faster than your tarnished does, and pressing the sprint button will give you a burst of speed in exchange for a bit of stamina (only in combat - when you're exploring your stamina won't be depleted). you can't exactly defend yourself on horseback, so you'll need to make use of torrent's speed and agility to evade attacks - and his double jump ability. with torrent you'll be able to explore much more of the lands between, and even utilize large gusting tornadoes called spiritsprings to rapidly ascend or descend vertical planes life cliffs and gorges. once you've met melina and gained your trusty spectral mount, you can fast travel back to the church of elleh and meet the snow witch, who will offer you spirit ashes and a spirit-calling bell. this this item, you can cast summonable spirits by finding their ashes to assist you in combat. they'll cost fp (or sometimes even hp) that will vary based on how strong the spirit is, how many of them appear, and what their moves are. spirits generally mimic the enemies you'll face in the lands between, so you can use their tactics and abilities to your advantage to overwhelm and redirect the attention of your enemies. spirit summons can only be cast when near specific sites - noted by the ghostly arch symbol that appears on the left side of the screen, which often shows up near boss fights, major enemy camps, and certain open areas in legacy dungeons. unlike summoning another player or npc, spirits won't make bosses stronger, so you can use them as an extension of your own abilities. as you explore the open world, be on the lookout for small caves and doors embedded into the rock walls and cliffs. these mini dungeons provide small challenging encounters that can comprise of anything from a few small rooms to winding catacombs or multi-level mines full of dangerous enemies and traps. these will all culminate with a miniboss that provides ample challenge, and allows you to summon friends or spirits to aid you in the fight. many of these dungeons are located off the beaten path, and many can easily be overlooked. be sure to keep a lookout for statues you can interact with to point the way, or ghostly candelabras that summon spirits who walk towards these secret entrances. as you follow the guidance of grace pointed out at the sites of grace you rest at, you may find them pointing to imposing looking castles and fortresses that tower over the landscape. these are the legacy dungeons that may be familiar to fans of the dark souls series, as they provide a more linear and harrowing experience compared to the wide open lands around them. these areas are extremely difficult, and feature some of the strongest bosses that include the demigods vying for control of this land. in these areas, you'll need to advance cautiously between checkpoints, and search for different avenues to advance, overcome obstacles, and find treasure along the way. spirit summons will be limited in these places, and powerful enemies will be numerous, but certain shortcuts can make return trips easier. you may also find that verticality plays a bigger role in these dungeons. fall damage is greatly reduced in many areas, allowing you to drop down to low rooftops, hop across gaps, and discover new secrets and routes to bypass patrols. as you spend your first few hours in limgrave, you may have lots of questions or run into things that might not make sense. be sure to get more info on these helpful how-tos to steer you in the right direction: how to fast travel how to get the flask of

latest from software game, and while it is not a sequel to the dark souls series, it does share many similarities - as well as many new aspects and mechanics not found in other from software games, including dark souls, bloodborne, and sekiro! this page contains helpful tips and information on things you should know in elden ring . see the video above for a trailer breakdown with help from hidetaka miyazaki elden ring takes place in a brand new world, not connected to the lands from dark souls or bloodborne. it is a large kingdom known as the lands between, and unlike previous fromsoftware games, it will be a large open world. the most striking aspect of the lands between is the large golden tree that can be seen from almost all areas, and it is known as the erdetree, which is reminiscent of yggdrasil, the world tree. it is said that the elden ring was the source of the erdtree, before it was shattered. there is also one "minor" erdtree in every region (though it looks anything but minor) not everyone was welcome in the lands between. a group known as the golden order once exiled many people from these lands, and they became known as the tarnished. now, with the elden ring shattered and the golden order broken, the tarnished (you, the player) have returned to the lands between to seek out the elden ring. as one of the tarnished, you'll be be able to pick from 10 different starting classes - each with their own starting gear, weapons, and even magic. while it is not yet known how the elden ring was broken, it has been revealed that its fragments are now kept by the remnants of the golden order, demigods, who have used its power to wage a great war. it is the quest of the tarnished to recover these elden ring shards, the great runes, and become an elden lord themselves. while the main goal of your character appears to be fueled by returning from exile to become an elden lord, miyazaki has hinted that your reasons and actions for doing so can be shaped by the player, and may configure into how you will interact with various npcs, and perhaps even choose an ending. these demigods are the offspring of the queen of the lands between, queen marika the eternal. much of the worldbuilding, background story, and character stories were written by author george r. martin, along with fromsoftware director hidetaka miyazaki. certain regions, like the starting area of limgrave , appear to be littered with large ruins that have seemingly fallen from the sky. the first from software game to have a truly open and explorable world, there will be a lot of traversing in elden ring. the lands between will have its own day/night cycle and dynamic weather system, and new enemies may appear during the night. you will be able to fast travel between sites of grace by consulting the map - though there are certain areas that prohibit fast travel, like certain dungeons . the lands between is comprised of six distinct open regions (each region ruled over by a demigod boss). each of these open regions will be home to a much larger dungeon (called "legacy dungeons"), and other more familiar and linear paths in line with a souls/borne game. all of these mainline dungeons are seamlessly connected to the larger lands between. the different regions you can explore will include forests, plains, ruins, and even swamps - and you'll also be able to adventure through various castles, fortresses, caves, and crypts. players will have access to a world map that lets you see the large open area of the lands between, but maps will not be available for some of the smaller and contained areas and dungeons. at the start, your map will only list sites of grace and major points of interest, but each region contains map stelles - large stone columns - that hold map fragments to reveal the topography of that region. you won't be able to see the full extent of the lands between when you open the map, as its maximum size will increase the more you explore, so you won't even know how big the map is until you explore it all. even though you won't be able to see many details until finding map fragments, your map will often have icons for stelle locations as a red-tinged obelisk, helping you find the map fragment for that region. miyazaki has stated that while you won't be able to access everything from the start, players will be able to choose how they want to approach each area, and there's a lot of freedom in the order you can approach each large area. there will be a hub area that links to the six main regions of the lands between, but it will not be available right at the start. most smaller dungeons are entirely optional, and it is also possible to bypass the larger legacy dungeons by finding routes around them - though this may make things harder for you down the line. to get around the open world faster, players can summon a mount that appears and disappears in a spectral summon, allowing you to call it to your side or dismiss it quickly. as well as attacking, you can also perform defensive maneuvers on your mount, including dashing, jumping, and even double-jumping. large gusts of wind known as spiritsprings allow you to jump up huge distances on your mount to quickly climb up cliffsides. you can also safely fall down into them from above. many enemies will patrol the open world, some following roads and paths, and others staying put. this may allow you to choose the place and time you wish to ambush and take on groups of enemies. some roaming bosses , like large dragons, can be fought in the larger open world, meaning you'll be able to fight them while still on your mount. due to the size of the lands between, there will be many alternate respawn points beside the sites of grace called stakes of marika. the small statues are often placed near difficult encounters, and an icon will be visible below your health bar when a nearby stake is active, allowing you to choose between respawning at the last site of grace or nearest stake of marika when killed. certain rooms and areas in the lands between may be locked behind barriers, requiring you to use special finite keys on nearby imp statues to unlock their secrets. certain mechanics from previous soulsborne games will be returning, including dark souls stamina bars, summoning, some of sekiro's basic stealth actions and dedicated jump button, as well as weapon arts (no longer just tied to specific weapons ). while the stamina bar is back, miyazaki has stated that they feel it has "less influence on the player overall", to help contribute to the level of freedom elden ring offers. this means that stamina will not diminish outside of combat, so you can sprint on foot or horseback indefinitely until attacked elden ring will have summonable co-op play, however, players can also summon ai spirits to help them out. these spirits are based on enemies you will encounter, and come in many forms, including animals and humanoids that can fulfill certain roles your character might be lacking (melee or ranged support). like spells, spirits cost fp to summon, and certain spirits come in groups, or cost more the more powerful the ally is. spirits can also be increased in power, and there are many to choose from - and you are able to find and choose which ones you want to assist you. spirits can only be summoned in certain areas, noted by a glowing grave-like icon that appears on the left side of the screen while dark souls featured weapons with specific arts, elden ring will feature around 100 different skills that can be found and collected as you explore the open world, called ashes of war. these skills can be customized to tailor your build as you see fit, and will not be limited to certain weapon pairings. ashes of war also allow you to customize your weapon scaling to better suit your build, though you can simply equip a skill without having to assign new scaling too. each weapon can have a single skill assigned to it, but the skill can be swapped out as needed to help experiment with your playstyle. an ash of war can only be applied to one weapon at a time, but it will be possible to duplicate them to apply them to multiple items. some weapons can even be given a "no skill" ash of war that lets you default to whatever weapon skill is in your other hand. certain weapons will have unique skills that cannot be exchanged. many magic spells can be cast while moving, or cast in repeated succession by holding the cast button down - so long as you have enough stamina and fp. other magic spells can be further enhanced by holding the cast button to charge them, and will still only use the same amount of fp. certain enemies can fight on horseback just like you can, and may be better suited to fighting them on a mount of your own. you can target the enemy or its mount to try and dismount it. you can perform a dismounting attack from horseback to launch yourself into a group of enemies. a jumping attack is much like a strong charged attack, and can deal incredible damage and break an enemy's stance to leave them vulnerable for a critical strike. while mounted, you can cast spells, or swing your weapon to the right with rb/rt, or the left with lb/lt as you might expect, spears and lance weapons excel on horseback, as you can joust and pierce enemies as you ride past them. many encampments feature enemies with large horns, and they will sound an alarm if they spot you, triggering all nearby enemies to converge on their location. stealth actions are limited but viable, allowing you to crouch down to reduce noise and visibility and try to ambush enemies. you can even crouch down to hide in tall grass. players can craft sleep bombs or arrows to quietly put sentries to sleep, where they can be bypassed or hit with a visceral attack. at night, it will be easier to use stealth mechanics to ambush enemies, but visibility will also be reduced. in addition to being able to use shield parries to perfectly time a deflection for an incoming attack, you can also perform guard counters by blocking an attack with your shield and pressing rt/r2 after it is been blocked, dealing immense damage in return (so long as you can land the attack) elden ring will introduce a new crafting mechanic that will allow to find and collect different materials as you explore and defeat enemies, and craft resources to help you survive longer, and will require crafting kit found early in the game. crafting components can be found by exploring the lands between to find various plants and stones, or hunting wild game or monsters to find the parts you need. new recipes can be learned by finding "cookbooks" that will give you more options to create both offensive and defensive items. since certain areas may have you fighting more and more enemies between rest points, crafting may be crucial to getting more healing items to stay in the fight longer. crafting cannot be done in combat, so you'll need to make necessary items ahead of time before delving into dangerous areas. explodable "pots" like firebombs are no longer bought, but crafted using a cracked pots. these items can be used to create a variety of different effects, and once thrown, the cracked pot will reform in your inventory to be used again. certain offensive tools can be crafted to deal magic attacks to enemies, known as "faux sorceries". these tools don't require magical affinity to use, but require fp to throw, allowing melee-focused characters to dabble in magic. like other from software games, there will be a host of mysterious npc characters you can meet in your travels. many of the characters you meet will have fully fleshed out backstories, including their own motivations for helping (or hindering) the player. like dark souls' firelink shrine, you'll be able to visit a hub location known as the roundtable hold where other tarnished can gather, and characters you meet in the lands between may show up there with new story and quests. characters may offer side quests, but quests won't be tracked on your map - however, npc locations will. many characters can be found while exploring off the beaten path in the lands between rewarding those who explore with more backstory into the world, and potentially more items and other rewards. npcs will reveal important parts of the story of elden ring that the player may not know about. this can even effect the ending of the game, depending on how you interact with these characters . the bosses of elden ring won't just be horrible monsters for the sake of it. thanks to author george r. martin, you'll be able to uncover the story behind many of these now twisted legendary demigods, and see how the fragments of the elden ring corrupted them - each in their own way. miyazaki has revealed that traditional mimics as we know them won't be featured in elden ring, but his wording suggests similar ambush-oriented enemies may make an appearance. co-op is confirmed to support up to 4 players. players can only invade another person's world if a co-op partner has already been summoned, meaning those who choose to play alone won't have to worry about being ambushed. those looking for a challenge can use a certain item that waives the need for a co-op partner to be present before you can be invaded. new interface elements have been added when joining another player's world to help navigate and team up. due to the nature of its large open world, there will be specific places that a player can call out for summon, making it easier to see where people need help. players can form specific groups to help out with friends in their open worlds, without having strangers ruin things. pvp will be enabled in elden ring, even in the large open worlds of the lands between. however, mounted combat will not be possible when summoning other players to fight against. summoning spirit ashes is not possible when playing multiplayer./n with a world as open and daunting as elden ring’s lands between, there are certain important things to do first - like finding out how to level up, get the hang of crafting, learn how to summon spirits, and much more. unlike the linear paths featured in many of fromsoftware’s previous action rpg games, elden ring wastes little time throwing you into a vast open world brimming with secrets, challenging encounters, and mysteries in every corner of the lands between. while nothing is stopping you from marching right up to stormveil castle - the first large legacy dungeon - you may benefit greatly from seeking out a few points of interest first. be sure to also check out things elden ring doesn't tell you all the important details you should know in elden ring and our essential tips and tricks for combat, exploration, and more! and pssst... this should really help you out as well: how to level up quickly: early rune farming locations one of the new additions to elden ring from the souls games is the ability to craft special items, such as fire pots, arrows, and even healing items for your horse. many of the items and consumables that were staples of the souls series must now be crafted instead, but you can’t do so right away. upon activating the first site of grace when stepping out into limgrave, follow the golden light trail (called the guidance of grace) up the path north to the church of elleh - just be sure to give the patrolling tree sentinel a wide berth! here you’ll find a merchant that will sell you the crafting kit for just a few hundred runes, which you may have gotten from the tutorial dungeon - otherwise you can head into the woods to the east and fight a few run-of-the-mill soldiers. with a crafting kit, you can utilize the many materials gained from plants, beasts, rocks, and certain enemies to make into items that can serve both offensive and defensive purposes. you’ll have a few basic recipes by default, and many more can be gained from books left all over the world, in dungeons, sold from merchants - and everything in-between. everything from different types of arrows, buffs, and weapon-enhancing grease can be crafted, and most materials you find will respawn each time you rest at a site of grace, so pick up everything you find! while you’re at the church of elleh, you should also pick up a torch, as some mini dungeons have limited light sources, and you don’t want to enter them unprepared. you can also find a smithing table nearby - this place will become very important during your limgrave exploration to enhance your chosen weapon to take on tougher targets. after visiting the church of elleh, the guidance of grace should be pointing you east, so follow the path along the nearby road through the trees and you’ll come across a large site known as the gatefront ruins. just north of the enemy camp is a large gate, and another site of grace lies just next to it. resting at this site of grace, (or whichever third grace you activate and rest at in the overworld), will introduce you to melina, an important npc that will let you spend your runes to level up in elden ring . melina will also give you the ability to summon torrent, your spirit horse that will be your main method of transportation across the lands between. once you are properly introduced, you’ll be able to exchange runes to level up at any site of grace you rest at - and you should aim to do so as much as possible. it’s easy to get swept up in expiration and forget to stop and spend those hard earned runes before you get killed and lose them! whether you chose spirit ashes as your starting keepsake or not, you’ll start to find more spirit ashes that can be used to summon friendly spirits to fight alongside you in certain situations - but you can’t do this as you are now. luckily, you shouldn’t have to wait long to learn how to summon spirits . after getting torrent, fast travel (don’t run) back to the church of elleh. if done correctly, the merchant kale will be passed out, and an eerie fog will have settled around the place. near the ruined walls, you can meet ranni the witch who gives you a summoning bell. this bell allows you to summon spirits to aid you in areas where a summoning icon is present (look for the white arch logo appearing in the left-middle part of the screen). spirit ashes come in many varieties - all based on the enemies you’ll face, and will cost fp in order to summon. generally, the more powerful or greater quantity of spirits summoned for a certain spirit ash, the more fp it will cost, and they can be invaluable in battle - whether wading into a battle against overwhelming odds alongside you, or helping to distract a tough boss and allow you time to heal or get in a strike at their back. once you’ve cleared the first legacy dungeon, you’ll even be able to upgrade the ashes you like to make them stronger, so be sure to find different spirit ashes and see which ones complement your playstyle the best. unlike summoning other players, spirit summons won’t increase the difficulty of a fight - but you can’t have friends join you for co-op and summon spirits at the same time, so you’ll need to choose wisely. to make the most of your new summoner’s bell, we recommend seeking out the following spirit ashes to give you plenty of summons to play with: the wandering noble ashes and noble sorcerer ashes are both found in the stormfoot catacombs to the north of the church of elleh the godrick soldier ashes are found among the graves in a cemetery in the far northwest part of storm hill, surrounded by jellyfish enemies outside the stormveil castle the jellyfish spirit ashes are given by a woman in a small shack up the road from the storm gate heading towards the castle itself. that large ruins at the foot of the imposing gate holds more than just a site of grace that melina appears at - the gatefront ruins is a point of interest teeming with important items to get, and it’s best if you explore it thoroughly. when you first open your map, you’ll notice that important locations and sites of grace are marked, but the rest is covered in a brown fog of war. you’ll need map fragments for each area to expose the topography, and they can be found at the base of large stone stelles - softly glowing obelisks with writing on them. the map fragment for west limgrave is located here - just be wary of approaching it due to the godrick knight patrolling the main path along with a scout that can sound a horn to summon his friends if he spots you. you should also scope out the edges of the ruins for two large carriages that are lightly guarded. each of these has a chest in the back that can be opened for two weapons that don’t take a lot of stat requirements to try out, the flail, and the lordsworn greatsword. be sure to try them out, and see their weapon skills in action against the soldiers here. speaking of weapon skills, you can search along the south side of the ruins to find an underground tunnel that leads to some ashes of war and the whetstone knife, which allows you to freely change out your ashes of war among your weapons. these are distinct abilities that can be switched out at sites of grace to suit your playstyle, and they affect stats and stat scaling on the weapons you use. whatever stat you’re building your character for, be it strength, dexterity, or even faith, having a weapon that scales with that stat exponentially will pay major dividends in the long run. if you’re looking for other great weapons that don’t have huge stat requirements, you should also check in these places: the dragon-burnt ruins found in the large lake area to the south of the gatefront ruins has a large walled section you can jump over with torrent to find a basement with a twinblade heading east from the lake under the large bridge will trigger an npc invasion - but if you manage to defeat them you can gain the reduvia dagger with an impressive weapon skill a large enemy encampment up in the northeast - far east of stormveil castle holds both a lance, and a beast crest heater shield - a medium shield with full physical absorption! while many ashes of war can be won by defeating certain powerful enemies - you can also buy a few from merchants to try swapping them in for your favorite weapons. sprint up the road through the storm gate until you reach a lone shack, and head right on a dirt road away from the castle until you reach the warmaster’s shack in the middle of a small wooded area. this merchant, berenahl, sells an assortment of different types of weapon skills for all types of armaments. this includes a powerful storm blade ranged attack, and the ability to add the parry skill to shields and certain small weapons, or even use the ash of war - no skill to leave your shield blank, allowing you to make use of your main armament’s skill without having to hold it in two hands! while there are several giant dungeons in elden ring that you can’t miss, there are tons of little dungeons peppered throughout the lands between. each of them varies in length from a few short rooms to more sprawling cave systems - and each ends with a mini boss challenge, as well as rewards to find along the way. mini dungeons can be found almost anywhere - but are mostly found as cave entrances or doors built into the side of rock walls. they can also be hard to spot, so make sure to look for telltale signs like lantern lights along the rocks, or creepy statues that point you in the right direction. you can find several in the west limgrave region, and you can select one of the following for more details: stormfoot catacombs groveside cave coastal cave murkwater cave murkwater catacombs limgrave tunnels deathtouched catacombs highroad cave you can explore the lands between and level up your attributes all you want, but the true measure of a warrior is by how powerful their chosen armaments are. using the smithing table at the church of elleh, you can upgrade your weapons up to +3 at the anvil, but in order to do that, you’ll need smithing stones. smithing stones are found literally everywhere - and often found on bodies in enemy camps, dungeons, or out of the way locations. one of the best places to pick them up is in the limgrave tunnels , across the lake from your starting area. not only do the miners inside sometimes drop these stones, they’ll often be found mining deposits you can loot to stockpile a good amount of them. once you have enough stones stockpiled to get a +3 weapon, you should be ready to take on stormveil castle. even after exploring the breadth of what west limgrave (and the other adjoining areas) has to offer, taking on stormveil castle may still be a daunting task due to the great enemy that guards the entrance - margit the fell omen . defeating him takes a lot of practice and patience - and perhaps something to even the odds. be sure to explore the small gorge running under the large bridge in limgrave, away from the lake. look along the left of the cliff walls and you can spot the entrance to a mini dungeon known as murkwater cave . we won’t spoil what hides in here, but completing this area should give you the chance to procure a very special item. when used, margit’s shackle can temporarily stun the intimidating boss for a few short moments, which can give you the upper hand to unleash some big attacks without fear of getting hit back. be warned - while it is reusable, you won't be able to get away with using it too many times in one fight. make the most of the opening it presents to get those strong hits in! as you spend your first few hours in limgrave, you may have lots of questions or run into things that might not make sense. be sure to get more info on these helpful how-tos to steer you in the right direction: how to level up quickly: early rune farming locations how to fast travel how to get the flask of wondrous physick how to access the roundtable hold how to access multiplayer (co-op, invasions) how to wield weapons in two hands how to escape the sellia crystal tunnel trap/n elden ring marks from software’s first attempt at a truly open-world game, and while it may seem a bit more forgiving than the souls series, there’s still plenty of information that isn’t explained to you. you’ll either have to seek out these easily missed points yourself, or check this list of things elden ring doesn’t tell you. be sure to also check out everything to do first in elden ring all the important details you should know in elden ring and our essential tips and tricks for combat, exploration, and more! just the simple act of being able to level up isn’t outright explained to you when you first start your adventure - though you’ll stumble into it eventually by activating three sites of grace in the overworld and resting. when you meet melina, she’ll not not only allow you to exchange runes to increase your stats, but will also give you the spectral steed, torrent. torrent can help with a lot more than just speeding across the map, and there’s a few things you should know when using your trusty steed: when mounted, you’ll put away your left-hand armament, and instead use the left and right bumpers and trigger buttons to use quick or strong attacks on either side. you can still cast spells or use bows, but you’ll have to swap to two-handing these instead of wielding a catalyst in the off-hand. this also means you can’t block attacks or dodge roll - you’ll have to double jump instead. torrent doesn’t sprint like you do on foot. instead, tapping the sprint button will use a small amount of stamina in exchange for a burst of speed, allowing you to outpace incoming attacks. when not in combat, you won’t use up stamina, so you can keep tapping the sprint button to keep up a fast pace. torrent has his own health bar, which can be hard to spot as it doesn’t appear often unless you’re both taking damage. a particularly strong attack will cause you to be knocked off as torrent disappears, leaving you highly vulnerable to follow up attacks. you can re-summon torrent once you're back on your feet, but if all of torrent’s hp is depleted, he won’t reappear until you either rest at a site of grace, or expend one charge of the flask of crimson tears to resurrect him. you can try and alleviate this by using area of effect healing magic or feeding crafted rowa raisins to torrent after a big fight. torrent may not always regen all of their hp when you respawn - specifically at a stake of marika rather than a site of grace. if you're planning on repeated attempts using mounted combat, be sure to check torrent's health as you mount up and make sure they are topped off. there are large vertical gusts of wind around the lands between called spiritsprings that let you jump up to great heights - but you might not realize you can also jump down them as well. as long as you aim carefully and land near one, you’ll see a gusting effect around torrent that negates any fall damage, allowing you to make jumps that would otherwise kill you. dangerous terrain like poison or scarlet rot swamps don't actually effect torrent. this means you can ride through hazardous areas without getting afflicted - just make sure you aren't knocked off your mount, or you'll be in a bad position. speed is key when engaging in mounted combat on torrent - but be wary when coming in to slice at opponents on the ground - if they have their shields raised, your attacks will cause you to slow down dramatically, allowing enemies to swarm you. strong attacks can also cause torrent to stumble and slow to a stop, giving room for enemies to keep you locked in place - so be wary. if torrent is killed or a particularly strong attack dismounts you, you'll be knocked to the ground and highly vulnerable. the heavier your equipment load, the longer you'll take to get up, letting enemies shred you to pieces if you don't have backup. fast traveling from your map is a new feature in fromsoftware games, and elden ring has a few rules about it that can be easily overlooked. since you can’t open your map in combat, you can’t fast travel in combat either, and the only item that warps you back to a site of grace in combat will use up all your runes. you also cannot fast travel while exploring the mini dungeons that dot the landscape - though defeating the boss of a dungeon will trigger a wisp of light that can warp you back to the entrance. interestingly, this does not apply to the larger legacy dungeons, meaning you can warp around the multiple sites of grace in the larger dungeons as much as you wish - or if you find yourself in a bad situation after taking a one-way trip down some rooftops. occasionally, there will be encounters that occur only when you fast travel to a certain location. for instance, once you’ve spoken to melina for the first time, if you fast-travel to the church of elleh, you’ll be greeted by someone who will offer you the spirit calling bell. similarly, after you’ve entered stormveil castle, if you fast travel to the warmaster’s shack in stormhill at night, you’ll be confronted by a very powerful invader. these options may not always be available to you though. certain enemies carry large horns or trumpets that they will use to call for backup if they spot you, bringing any other enemies rushing over to fight. this can be overwhelming pretty quickly if the horn bearers aren’t taken out first, so you may choose to prioritize them, or play more stealthily until they are defeated. certain larger than life roaming world bosses like dragons can quickly turn large parts of a region into a battlefield as they rip apart trees and crash through rocks to chase you around their lair. if you move too far away from an overworld boss’ battleground, they may disappear without warning, and warp back to where you first spotted them, which disengages you from the fight the good news is this doesn’t regenerate their health or reset the event. you’ll be able to race back and pick up where you left off - or use the time to recharge and get ready to finish the fight, or come back later. besides resting at a site of grace to replenish your hp and fp flasks (which also resurrects defeated enemies), you can also restore charges by defeating groups of enemies in the open world. often, the more difficult or numerous the foes, the more charges you’ll earn back. this can happen in fortified enemy encampments, single patrolling knights, or even with groups of wild animals. this mechanic is key to exploring more of the lands between without needing to rest at a site of grace every 5 minutes, and sometimes it’s worth seeking out a group of enemies you know you can handle easily when you’re low on charges to get some more before proceeding to a more difficult location. you can also keep an eye out for red or blue teardrop scarabs and kill them to get additional charges. however, it’s important to remember that this won’t happen for enemies inside dungeons, so prepare for these endeavors accordingly. at certain points in elden ring you may hear about “those that live in death”. this generally refers to enemies like skeletons - and you may find that once struck down, they can often resurrect themselves fully to keep harassing you. the easiest way around this is by using holy magic, crafting holy pots, or imbuing your weapon with a holy effect - as this will make sure these enemies die outright. if you lack access to such tools, you can still defeat them using “normal” weapons. once their bones hit the ground, look for a white glow on the ground as they come back to life. make sure to hit them during this animation to finish them for good, or they’ll regenerate back to full health. note that in very certain instances - some undead may resist being killed a final time. this is most often due to a necromancer lurking nearby. look for the black and white flames that emanate from them - and if you see them, hunt down the necromancer to kill all skeletons in the area. dungeon exploration in elden ring is more focused on platforming than previous soulsborne games, since you’ll be able to freely jump at will. this means there is much more room to explore or deviate from the main path, and the concept of “out of bounds” has shifted dramatically. you can now jump to rooftops across ramparts and crumbling walls, down buildings, and across gaps to find new areas, secrets, and alternate paths. fall damage is greatly reduced in elden ring compared to previous titles as well (even moreso in certain parts of legacy dungeons) so feel free to be a little bit more adventurous. when in the map view of the lands between, you'll start racking up a lot of different sites of grace - some in the open world, some in dungeons, and even one for the roundtable hold. you can press y to see a drop down list of sites of grace. while in this mode, you can press x to quickly teleport to the roundtable hold, or hold l3 to mark your favorite sites you travel to the most, and then filter the list by favorited sites of graces. alternatively, you can use it as a way to mark which dungeons you've completed, and which places you've decided to try at a later point. due to the importance of the titular elden ring, you won’t find regular rings to equip as you explore. instead, you’ll find talismans to give you passive bonuses, but you’ll only start with one slot - but there is a way to get more by tackling tough bosses and progressing the story. the same goes for spell memory, as you’ll only have two slots to “equip” spells at a site of grace, and just increasing your intelligence won’t grant more. luckily, you can get more either from merchants, or gaining access to certain sorcerer towers all over the lands between. elden ring features certain types of teleporters that can send you far from your current location to different regions in the lands between. some are hidden in remote areas, some are unlocked using special keys, and others can help you cross impossible gaps. you won’t know where you’ll end up until you appear on the other side - and many of them only teleport you one way. certain teleporters may even be utilized as traps in chests (instead of mimics that will eat you). these traps often place you in dangerous locations - but unlike the other teleporters, if you get caught by one of these, you won’t be able to fast travel or respawn at a site of grace until you find a new one. use extra care when navigating your way out, as dying will just send you right back to where the teleporter trap dropped you. as you explore, you may come across certain barriers or inactive places, that feature a twin fanged imp statue nearby. these can unlock gateways, treasures, mini dungeons, and even optional bosses. if you find a stonesword key, you can unlock these barriers by inserting them into the imp statues (some will require 1, others 2), but doing so will use up that key. you’ll have to think hard about when and where you want to use them. luckily, you can these keys all around - sold from merchants, located on bodies in secluded areas, and found in legacy dungeons. see our list of stonesword key locations , and imp seal locations poisonous swamps are a pain to deal with no matter who you are, but there are ways to make it easier or harder on you. some swamps will slow your movement considerably - but you can still hold down the run button to move quickly through them. whatever you do - avoid rolling in poison much at all costs. while you can usually run between dry land and wait for the poison meter to subside a bit before moving onwards, rolling through poison will cover you in the stuff, causing your meter to rise continously even when outside of the poison field itself. any amount of restorative cures will not stop the continouous buildup, you'll have to wait until it finally subsides - so if you're engaged in combat, it's often better to block incoming attacks than roll away! once you kill a demigod in their legacy dungeons and collect their great rune, it actually won’t be of any use to you until you power it up. you can equip them at a site of grace, but it will lack its true potential when first gained. each great rune must be activated at the holy towers found in each region of limgrave, and each one will have different requirements to reach the tower. for example, with godrick’s great rune, which you get after clearing stormveil castle, you must first head to the limgrave tower, located across the bridge at the east exit in stormveil castle. once you reclaim the power of the rune at the top of the tower, you’ll be able to equip it at a site of grace - but this alone won’t grant you its power. to unlock the power of a great rune, you’ll need to use rare consumables called rune arcs to draw upon its full power. unlike other item buffs, this one will last until the next time you die. because of this, you’ll want to consider when to use the consumable rune arcs very carefully, as they are hard to find. thankfully, there is a small chance to find them by killing enemies - rats, specifically, in case you want to try getting more without searching the world or buying them from merchants. see more information on how to activate great runes. demigods won’t just give you a great rune when defeated - they’ll also give elden ring’s version of a boss soul - a remembrance. and just like boss souls, you’ll be able to exchange these for a great amount of runes, or extremely special weapons, armor, or spells. normally, you’d have to make a difficult decision on how to use the remembrance, but as it turns out there is a way to have your cake and eat it, too. in different regions of the lands between you may find giant wandering mausoleums and crash about the land on four legs like titans. once you find a way to bring them down, you can enter them to duplicate a remembrance, allowing you to get multiple rewards from the same boss. of course, this can only be done once per mausoleum, so you can’t duplicate them forever! see more information on how to duplicate boss remembrances as you spend your first few hours in limgrave, you may have lots of questions or run into things that might not make sense. be sure to get more info on these helpful how-tos to steer you in the right direction: how to fast travel how to get the flask of wondrous physick how to access the roundtable hold how to access multiplayer (co-op, invasions) how to wield weapons in two hands how to escape the sellia crystal tunnel trap/n this elden ring guide covers all of the currently known endings that can be unlocked at the final stage of your journey across the lands between. on this page, you can expect details of the different endings you'll encounter depending on the choices you've made in the game, as well as the questlines you'll need to have completed to unlock them. there are currently six known endings to elden ring, with the age of fracture considered to be the standard ending. the other five are achieved by completing side quests from various npcs you will have encountered in the lands between. below are details on how to unlock each ending, and what that means for your tarnished. this is the standard ending for elden ring, seeing your tarnished take the throne and become elden lord after choosing to mend the elden ring after the final boss battle. getting this ending only requires you to follow the story and beat each of the main bosses . to achieve this ending, you’ll need to have completed the ranni the witch questline so you can use the dark moon ring on ranni. after the last boss battle, you can summon ranni using the stones. she’ll promise that now is the ages of the stars, and refer to your character as her consort, eternal. to get this ending you'll have to follow these steps: to achieve this ending, you’ll need to have completed the brother corhyn questline . this will give you the option to use mending rune of perfect orde r instead of mend the elden ring after the final boss battle. this ending seems to repair the lands between after the burning of the erdtree and restore order. to get this ending you'll have to follow these steps: to achieve this ending, you’ll need to have completed the fia questline and the ranni the witch questline to the point where you receive the statue to invert carian hall. this will allow you to use mending rune of the death-prince instead of choosing to mend the elden ring after the final boss battle. it sees your tarnished take the throne, as ashes fall around them. to get this ending you'll have to follow these steps: after the boss battle, choose to become lord of the frenzied flame instead of elden lord. to achieve this ending, you’ll need to find the three fingers in the subterranean shunning-grounds . to get this ending you'll have to follow these steps: this ending is connected to the hyetta questline and seems to have a connection to the bloody finger hunter yura questline , too. to achieve this ending, you’ll need to complete the dung eater questline that sees you give dung eater enough seedbed curse to free his form and get the mending rune of the fell curse . after the boss battle, you’ll then be able to choose to either: mend the elden ring or use mending rune of the fell curse. by choosing use mending rune of the fell curse , your tarnished will become elden lord but also unleash destruction upon the lands between with a vile curse. to get this ending you'll have to follow these steps:/n like dark souls and bloodborne before it, elden ring includes the option to embark upon new game plus (ng+) upon completion of the game and defeating the final boss. this page includes information on how new game plus works, what does and does not carry over, and an extensive checklist of essential items, questlines, and secrets you should claim before moving onto your next run with your character. in fromsoftware games, new game plus is a way for you to continue your adventures with the character you have leveled up to start the game again, while keeping your character's level, equipment, spells, and more intact. enemies will get harder to compensate for your increased abilities at the start of the game, but you'll be able to utilize more skills and abilities against them than you would have if you started a fresh character. new game plus also allows you to continue leveling up your character, increasing their rune level and allowing you to get matched with higher level characters in multiplayer. though certain attributes have diminishing returns after a certain point, you'll be able to keep increasing your power as you make your way through subsequent new game plus, as you'll be able to beat the game and enter another new game plus (ng1, ng2, ng3, etc) many times over. once you have beaten the final boss and triggered one of the various endings, you'll be prompted to begin your next journey and trigger new game plus right away. if you choose this, you'll be put into an all-new save file that carries over the features listed below. if you decline to play new game plus, you'll be sent back to right before the final boss, and can explore the lands between and pick up anything you missed or continue exploring - though you cannot re-fight the final boss or pick another ending. when you are ready, you can return to the roundtable hold and rest at the large site of grace to "begin journey 2". most of what will come with you into ng+ is dependant on your core character and what they have on them. there are many different features that will carry over depending on what you've picked up in the previous run, and include the following features: your character's rune level, and current attribute and stat points allocation weapons (including upgrade levels), armor, magic sorceries and incantations, and talismans standard consumable items crafting materials and bolstering upgrade materials cookbooks (and the associated crafting recipes) larval tears boss remembrance item rewards (but not the remembrances themselves) spirit ash summons (included upgrade levels, and the spirit calling bell) gestures and unlocked emotes map fragments (the map and any points of interest you have unlocked on your map will still be there, but you will have to rediscover sites of grace to fast travel to them) your upgraded flask of crimson/cerulean tears (including charges and potency) the spectral steed whistle (ability to summon torrent) your character's starting class (used as a basis for respecing) and chosen starting keepsake (you will not be able to choose a new one) each time you begin a new journey, there are some features and items that will be removed from your inventory, prompting you to seek these things out on your next ng+ journey. this will include the following: great runes (both the demigod great runes and story-related mending runes must be aquired and empowered again). key items related to story progression (including keys that open locked areas, lift medallions, and other important story items) quest items related to characters, side quests, etc (including deathroot) spellbooks, scrolls, and prayerbooks (spells learned from trading in spellbooks will still carry over if purchased before starting ng+) boss remembrances (the items you are rewarded will remain - so activate the remembrances before starting ng+. wandering mausoleums will also be reset) sites of grace must be re-triggered to enable them once more. imp seals, barriers, and certain sending gate teleporters will be re-sealed until you unlock them again with stonesword keys, imbued stonesword keys, or trigger their unlock via progression. all bell bearings (both those that have been given to the twin maiden husk and those still in your inventory will be gone, but any npcs killed to obtain them will have respawned). character cosmetic alteration from the dragon communion or lord of frenzy flame questline all status with npc characters and their questlines will be reset there are many different things you can collect or complete before starting your next journey, and they may depend heavily on what you anticipate focusing on in your next playthrough. some players want to complete every single challenge before moving on, while others only want what certain items to prepare themselves for ng+. the checklists below are divided up based on the different things you can collect or complete that will help carry over certain elements. boss remembrance rewards weapons, armor, and talismans dragon smithing stones larval tears spells and prayerbooks dragon hearts other new game plus checklists while remembrances do not carry over in ng+, the items you receive will, be they weapons, spells, or talismans. be sure to defeat all the following main bosses and use their remembrances in the roundtable hold to get the rewards, and then use the 7 wandering masuloeums to get both rewards for certain remembrances or duplicate weapons if you intend to dual-wield them (demigod remembrances require a mausoleum with a bell) defeat godrick the grafted defeat rennala, queen of the full moon defeat starscourge radahn defeat rykard, lord of blasphemy defeat morgott, the omen king defeat regal ancestor spirit defeat astel, naturalborn of the void defeat lichdragon fortissax defeat hoarah loux, warrior defeat fire giant defeat maliketh, the black blade defeat dragonlord placidusax defeat mohg, lord of blood defeat malenia, blade of miquella defeat elden beast there are many different types of weapons and armor to obtain as you explore the lands between - some are found in chests, some from defeated enemies, or purchased from merchants. you don't necesarily need to find everything before starting new game plus, but it helps to have as much items to choose from as you can when starting a new game. see the full list of all weapons , all armor , and all talismans with our guides on where to obtain them. in particular, you may want to try an obtain all of the legendary weapons and legendary talismans to obtain the related achievements before starting over - but note that if you miss the legendary spear located in leyndell before turning the capital to ash, you'll have to start a new game to get it. in addition, there are some weapons and armor that can only be obtained by killing certain npcs. given that all questlines reset, you can do this before starting new game plus and feel no remorse! many characters will die anyway at the end of their questlines, but some do not, like patches and tanith. while you can eventually buy as many smithing stones as you like after finding the associated bell bearings late in the game, the final upgrade tier cannot be bought, and you can only find a finite number of them in each playthrough - 13 ancient dragon smithing stones, and 8 somber ancient dragon smithing stones. be sure to collect all of them before starting ng+, or as many as you can, to give yourself more upgrade options in your next journey. side with jerren during sorceress sellen's questline give gurranq

builds, and these are facilitated by respecing your character by way of rennala, queen of the full moon. while you'll have to reaquire the ability to respect in new game plus, you can make sure you respec before starting, or have the larval tears needed to try when you gain the ability again. like the ancient dragon smithing stones, these are finite drops found from mimics in the following locations: dropped by a mimic in west limgrave disguised as a noble undead east of lake agheel, who turns into a runebear. dropped by a mimic in north liurnia that patrols south of the rose church,

disguised as a pilgrim, who will turn into a runebear. there are a lot of different sorceries and incantations you can collect by exploring the lands between. like weapons and armor, you can find them in a variety of ways, but the most important way is by getting sorcery scrolls and prayerbooks. while these items don't carry over into ng+, the spells you can purchase will, by giving them to the right merchants. due to certain npc questlines leading them to their deaths, we recommend giving extra scrolls and books to miriel, pastor of vows located at the church of vows in liurnia, as he will take all kinds. be sure to get the following items turned in for the spells you can then buy. located on a body in raya lucaria academy , near the schoolhouse classroom.

(unlocks ancient dragon's lightning spear and ancient dragon's lightning strike) be sure to also pick up the legendary spells before you start your next journey. there are a lot of optional bosses to clear out before you make your final push into new game plus, but unless you're looking for a specific item or reward, most of them can be attempted in new game plus without losing too much. however, it's a good idea to at least hunt down all the dragons in the lands between that drop a dragon heart, and unlock special dragon incantations at the cathedral of dragon communion in caelid. many incantations will only become available to buy if you kill specific dragons, and you'll need every last dragon heart to get all the rewards. located in west limgrave's lake. unlocks agheel's flame

snowfield near the entrance to the cave of the forlorn . unlocks theodorix's magma incantation. the following tasks may not be as important to some, but it still worth looking over to make sure you have everything you need before starting your next adventure: purchase all items from the nomadic merchants, finger reader, and twin maiden husk that you can, especially unique items like armor and weapons. complete as many character sidequests as you can that are still active, and make note of which choices you make for certain questline (siding with sorceress sellen or jerren, siding with ranni or seluvis, tanith's assassination missions, completing the flame of frenzy or keeping melina as your maiden). find and collect all the crystal tears for the flask of wondrous physick. collect the max number of key items that carry over - including 20 cracked pots, 10 ritual pots, 10 perfume bottles, 8 memory stones, and 3 talisman pouches. do a final respec from rennala if you want a new

the small dungeons found in the limgrave region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few treasure items and a miniboss foe. this page contains information on the location, walkthrough, and guide to traverse this dungeon, locate all of its treasure, and tips to defeat the enemies within. enemies boss notable loot wolves beastman of farum azula flamedrake talisman groveside cave is found along the north part of the limgrave region, located at a cave entrance in the forests between the church of elleh and the gatefront ruins, just south of storm hill along the cliffs, and located northeast of the fringefolk hero's grave. the outside of the dungeon is located along the bottom of the cliff walls and you can find a small fire pit by the entrance, with a few godrick soldiers wandering nearby. entering the cave, you'll soon find a site of grace emitting light near the entrance, and while the tunnel ahead may look foreboding, there will be plenty of light later on so you won't need to carry a torch for this dungeon. the tunnel will empty out into the dungeon's main room, where you'll be standing on a high platform overlooking a campfire that has been taken over by a group of wolves. first, you can check the ledge to the left to find 3 cave moss , and on the right, before sniping the wolves below with ranged attacks if you have any, or trying to lure them to climb up to fight you. try to get them to attack one at a time, and if you appear to be overwhelmed, drop down below and make them chase you to give yourself time to recover. there should be three regular wolves around the fire as well as one all-white alpha wolf that has a bit more health and damage output than the rest, so try to kill the rest before taking it on. after clearing the camp, look along the edge of the campfire among the barrels for a body holding a cracked pot we, and then head to the far side of the cave to find a small pool of water guarded by two more wolves. after killing them, you can find more cave moss , as well as a 5 silver firefly in the water near a body holding a golden rune , and another holding 3 glowstone . from here, look around the right side of the lower part of this cave for a small tunnel, and follow it to find one last wolf guarding the fog gate to the boss of this dungeon near some more cave moss . this humanoid boss can be tough and aggressive until you learn his attacks, but thankfully doesn't have a whole lot of health or defense being one of the early dungeon bosses you can encounter. the room is wide enough that there's plenty of space to retreat and wait for your next opening, so be on the move constantly. the beastman wields a large sword that it can use in a slow but surprisingly far reaching lunge attack, or an equally slow slam where it lifts its weapon in both hands horizontally over its head before lunging forward to bring it down. this foe can also attack with a few different 2-hit combos, as well as a 3 hit combo ending in an overhead slamming attack. don't get too greedy in countering after the lunge or 3-hit attack as the beastman will quickly step backward into a retreating spinning slice that can catch you offguard if you're mid-swing - so know when to retreat. when the beastman gets low on health, it may start howling and prepare for a flurry attack, leading it to slice at you up to five times ending in an upward slash - bringing it up into the air before it slams down for a sixth hit. once you see the attack coming, get defensive and wait until the upward slash before dodging behind the final blow to get in several hits while the foe is vulnerable. remember that you can use spirit summons in this fight to divert the attention of the boss away from you, even if they don't last long, the boss doesn't have too many attacks with wide enough swings to protect its back. keep getting in hits where you can while being prepared to dodge its retreating swipes or lunges, and the beastman of farum azula will fall. once dead, you'll recieve the flamedrake talisman , and if you want to leave the dungeon quickly, look around the ruined campsite for a tendril of light to teleport you back to the entrance. /n the stormfoot catacombs is one of the small dungeons found in the limgrave region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few treasure items and a miniboss foe. this page contains information on the location, walkthrough, and guide to traverse this dungeon, locate all of its treasure, and tips to defeat the enemies within. enemies boss notable loot fanged imps erdtree burial watchdog wandering noble ashes , noble sorcerer ashes stormfoot catacombs is found along the northwestern part of the limgrave region, located through a large door at the bottom of a small dip along the cliffsides that separate storm hill from the area north of the church of elleh and where the stranded graveyard is located. you can find a small statue on one of the bluffs to the south that will point you in the direction of the dungeon. the outside of the dungeon is located along the bottom of the cliff walls and you can usually spot a few wandering nobles patrolling the area with torches - though they are far from aggressive, and there are plenty of mushroom and other crafting materials to harvest from the bushes near the entrance. entering through the large door built into the cliff face, the catacombs presents a site of grace down the first flight of stairs, before leading down narrow hallways where a friendly spirit offers a few words. there's a fork in the path soon after, and going straight leads to a small room with an empty chair, and a body in front of it next to a waiting fanged imp. these enemies can rush in fast when they want to, slicing and dicing to cause bleed - and letting them hit you for too long will cause a huge burst of bloodloss, even if you block - so dodge or go on the offensive. if they spot you at range, they'll start hurling tiny but damaging projectiles, but you can close the distance quickly before they can switch gears. another fanged imp waits just to the left of the room entrance to lunge out and ambush you, so move in cautiously with your shield up and prepare to retaliate after it slashes at you, being ready to react to the other fanged imp in the room to throw projectiles at you. clear both of them out, and loot the body on the floor for 2 tarnished blossom . heading down the flight of stairs on the right side of the narrow path, you'll come to a room with a large locked door and a summoning pool statue, and some grave glovewort 1 on the right. take the path on the left down some stairs to continue on. this will lead you to a large room with multiple levels, and you should be prepared for several fanged imps to throw projectiles at you from one floor above, and you can take shelter in the passageway below until they drop down to fight you, or use ranged attacks and spells on them until they come to you. while under the balconies above, look around for some grave violet , and another grave glovewort 1 . since you can't get up from this level yet, keep moving forward down a narrow tunnel until you reach a room with a long hallway that's being blasted by a fire trap at the end of the hall. it will shoot out flame blasts in short bursts, giving you just enough time to race down the hall and dive to the right for an opening. from this spot, be sure to wait for the next blast and run back into the hall and reach the fire trap, and strike it to cause it to lower. you'll even find a body behind it holding a prattling pate hello item. moving back to the next hallway with another flame trap, a fanged imp or two might run forward to greet you, but you can use the flame traps to hit them instead before running to disable the second flame trap. behind it, you may spot up to five fanged imps waiting to ambush you on the far wall and alcoves, hovering over some ghost glovewort and a body that holds 3 smouldering butterfly . take out the imps with care before looking for an alcove on the right side of the hall for a ladder going up. this will take you back to the multi-story room you were in earlier, with a fanged imp on the left right as you enter next to some more grave glovewort 1 , and another at the far end that will race to attack you. before you drop down to the second level, keep traveling forward down a tunnel to face two more fanged imps in a small room guarding more grave glovewort 1 , and more importantly, a body holding wandering noble ashes , that can be summoned as spirits to fight for you, once you obtain a spirit calling bell. now, return to the multi-tier room and drop to the second balcony where you'll find a lever to pull, and possibly another fanged imp or two lying in wait nearby, and some grave glovewort 1 next to a lever. the lever will open the door in the room back up the stairs. now you can enter to find the boss of this dungeon. this foe is a straightforward one, but can still deal a ton of damage with its attacks if you aren't paying attention or fighting carefully. it is a large stone statue with a big sword and fire-tipped tail, and will move fairly slowly much of the time as it sits on its haunches. however, it can suddenly extend its height by standing on its hind legs and cross to you quicker than you might expect to attack, or even float across the room to crash down on you, so be ready for a multitude of attacks don't be fooled, as it can quickly lower its sword to thrust forward with decent range, or raise the sword high to slash down vertically, diagonally, or horizontally. if it slams its sword down to the side, it means that the boss is about to launch a spinning attack, which is your cue to backpedal out of range. many of its swings do take a few moments to charge up and cool down, giving you a brief chance to get some hits in of your own before waiting for its next attack. use these chances wisely and do not get greedy or deplete your stamina early, as you'll need to be ready to get away at a moment's notice. some of its more powerful attacks include when its head begins to start shaking wildly, as it will soon start pivoting to face you while spewing fire in your direction, meaning you'll either have to strafe quickly or back off and used ranged attacks while it's stuck in the animation. when it decides to stand up tall, it will try to approach you can slam down its sword vertically at a fairly quick rate, but a well-timed dodge can leave it open to a counter-attack. the erdtree burial watchdog can also float into the air, which should tell you to be extremely careful. it will rise into the air as it moves toward you, before slamming into the ground sword first to send out a shockwave. the worst part about this move is that it can do this multiple times, and you'll need to dodge in rapid succession to avoid getting slammed. stay on the defensive until it stops rising back into the air, and let your stamina reset before engaging it again. if using ranged or magic attacks, always wait until after its strikes to backpedal and let loose some of your own, or you might be caught mid-animation by its quick sword lunge or downward slams. since it is fairly slow, you can usually keep out of range of its telegraphed attacks. with its long slow strikes, you should be able to dodge past them and retaliate a little each time before the boss finally falls, and killing it will drop the noble sorcerer ashes , another spirit summon. to exit the dungeon quickly, look for a wispy trail of light that will teleport you back to the entrance. /n the coastal cave is one of the small dungeons found in the limgrave region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few treasure items and two miniboss foes, and allows access to a nearby island. this page contains information on the location, walkthrough, and guide to traverse this dungeon, locate all of its treasure, and tips to defeat the enemies within. enemies boss notable loot demi-humans demi-human chief x2 tailoring tools , sewing needle coastal cave is found along the western coast of the limgrave region, located as a cave entrance among the cliffs. it can be found due west of the cave of knowledge entrance, with beach access located a bit to the north, west of the church of elleh. the outside of the dungeon is usually home to a group of demi-humans during the nighttime, and just south of the cave entrance is a large half-circular ruin embedded on the side of the cliff, under which hides a nomadic merchant you can trade with. warning: the inside of the cave is near pitch black, and you'll need a torch to find your way around, which can be bought from merchant kale at the church of elleh. just inside the cave entrance where the light begins to fade, you can spot a site of grace to rest at before proceeding furth into the depths. have your torch out in your offhand as you move down the passage until you spot some cave moss on the left next to a demi-human standing guard over a larger cave area below. if you hug the right wall, you'll find a small tunnel leading down to more cave moss and two more demi-humans. they'll likely scream for help, and charge you with either sword and shield or large club, so bait out their attacks and then counter with your own, and they should fall quickly. the bottom of the tunnel path leads back out to the large cave you approached from above earlier, and there may still be a few more demi-humans waiting in the dark, so move forward cautiously to bait them out one at a time, then look in the far left corner for a group of demi-humans by some cave moss . when you're ready to move on, look to the far right wall for a body holding 3 root resin by the entrance to a larger open cave room. this fight can be an unorthodox one, as there is no fog gate, and the two boss enemies will be asleep at first, allowing you to make the first move. however, there are also several patrolling demi-humans in this long arena that can make things difficult on top of trying to contend with two boss enemies. before you head in, you have the option to use the gold summon sign in the entryway to bring in old knight istvan to help you . luckily, the two demi-human chiefs are on opposite sides of the room, and so long as you don't make too much noise and keep your initial fighting around the entrance to this room, you can defeat the first chief without disturbing the other. entering the room, you should spot two demi-humans patrolling along the length of the watery cave between two patches of tall shrubs - and the first demi-human chief is lying to the left on the other side of a rocky pillar along with a smaller demi-human that guards the chief. knowing this, you can try to sit in the brush on the right and backstab the patrolling demi-humans to thin their ranks before taking on the chief nearby, but it may not be possible to kill them all without alerting one of the bosses. the demi-human chief attacks with two long knives, and can either run up to you and slam them down with a short delay, or jump into the air for a leaping strike. it can also charge up for a spinning strike that can deal a lot of damage, or start moving forward with alternating swings for a 3-4 hit combo attack. luckily, it may often take a moment to strafe around you or prepare between attacks, giving you precious seconds to clear the area of smaller demi-humans that might otherwise get in your way. the demi-human chief is also easily staggered and doesn't have as much health as a traditional boss, so you can power through one of them quickly by either using weapon skills, flame grease, or summoning a spirit to divert their attention. once the first is defeated, carefully advance to the other side of the room to attract the attention of the second demi-human chief or its lackeys by the cave exit, and let it come to you and lunge, taking advantage of its lengthy downtime between its slams and jump attacks to go on the offensive and keep it staggered so it can't fight back. if you manage to get both of them on you at the same time, you'll need to be constantly moving, and try to use spirit summons to divert attention away from you, or you'll be facing tough opposition as they'll likely try to flank you. try using the large rock pillar by the entrance to break line of sight and cause them to reorient themselves before they can attack again, giving you time to strike out and dart away again. defeating this room will reward you with the tailoring tools , as well as boc's sewing needle , and while a light that can teleport you to the entrance will appear, you can keep moving through the passage at the back of the tunnel to exit onto the small island west of limgrave where the church of dragon communion is, and holds several spells, another site of grace, and a teardrop scarab for you to find. /n the murkwater catacombs is one of the small dungeons found in the limgrave region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few treasure items and a miniboss foe. this page contains information on the location, walkthrough, and guide to traverse this dungeon, locate all of its treasure, and tips to defeat the enemies within. enemies boss notable loot fanged imps grave warden duelist battle hammer murkwater catacombs can be found at the end of a long watery ravine in the central area of the limgrave region. it can be reached either by traveling under the large bridge that crosses the east area of agheel lake (be wary of resurrecting skeletons near the bridge and an npc invasion soon after), or you can use your spectral mount torrent to hop down at the end of the ravine from above, using the large gravestone platforms jutting out of the cliffs to soften your fall. the outside of the dungeon is surrounded by several slow-moving slime creatures, and there is a site of grace on the cliffs above the ravine, as well as one right inside the dungeon entrance. entering the catacombs, follow the narrow path past a site of grace to the first wider room full of large burial watchdog statues. at the end of the room, you may spot two fanged imps - one on the far wall, and one on the ceiling. they can be easy to miss and therefore ambush you if you move forward too quickly, so you may wish to bait them out of hiding with ranged or magic attacks. there is also one tucked in the left corner of the room as you enter, so be careful not to let it surprise you from behind. the fanged imps dart around fast and can deal rapid damaging blows, but are vulnerable to magic and follow-up guard counter attacks. once both enemies in the room are defeated, be sure to search the left corner for northern mercenary ashes , a very powerful spirit summon. the next passageway leads to a fork in the tunnels - you can go straight first - but there's a pressure plate trap ahead that will a salvo of flaming arrows as two fanged imps throw daggers at you from the room. you'll either have to charge them with shield up, or lure them back into the hallway and trigger the trap to hit them too - but a third stone goblin is waiting in the corner of the room behind the doorway to ambush you. with the room clear, you can pull a lever to open the door to the boss of this dungeon. taking the lower tunnel path on the right leads to another pressure plate trap that will fire more salvos into front of a room in front of you, where two more fanged imps wait by the door, and another hides in the shadows. defeat them and grab the urgent heal before passing through the door now that has been opened by using the lever mentioned earlier - and prepare for the boss of this dungeon. the grave warden duelist is a humanoid miniboss of the murkwater catacombs, and wields two impressively sized hammers that it swings with reckless abandon. this is an incredibly aggressive fighter, making it hard to catch a break unless you are equally aggressive or know how to use your stamina conservatively. the grave warden will run at you and alternate three or five-hit combos with large swings of their hammers that always end in a double slam attack. they may start the combo by trying to pull you in with a hammer first before beginning the combo attack. they may also follow up these attacks after a few moments by swinging one of their hammers on a chain to swing it in a long arc. if you try to fight at range, be ready for a large leaping attack with a slam you'll have to dodge around. they can follow this up by putting both hammers in one hand and leaving the other outstretched, signaling a forward lunging grab you'll have to dodge to avoid. once their health begins to drop to around half, they may buff themselves with a damage boost that turns them red - making their damage even more potent and requiring you to block their powerful strikes. for melee fighters, the best way to defeat the boss with little trouble is to master the art of the shield parry. all of the grave warden's melee strikes can be parried, and like any other enemy that can be parried, they'll immediately become vulnerable to a critical strike. with a good weapon in hand, you can chain parry after parry and defeat it fairly quickly after multiple critical strikes. if you try to use a spirit summon for this encounter, you'll likely need one that can tank a few blows like the northern mercenary found earlier in the dungeon, and use it to divert the grave warden's attention while you attack from behind. defeating this boss will earn you his battle hammer , and trigger a way to warp back to the dungeon entrance. /n murkwater cave is one of the small dungeons found in the limgrave region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few treasure items and a miniboss foe. this page contains information on the location, walkthrough, and guide to traverse this dungeon, locate all of its treasure, and tips to defeat the enemies within. enemies boss notable loot highwaymen patches cloth garb , cloth trousers , grovel for mercy murkwater cave is found in the northeastern section of the limgrave region, in a long stretching canyon stretching diagonally upwards from lake agheel. around halfway through the canyon, you’ll notice a small cave on the left-hand side, denoted by a hanging flame basket. if it is your first time in the canyon, you’ll be invaded by bloody finger nerijus . this spirit has devastating bleed attacks, with thrown daggers and a flurry of blade slices. backtrack through the canyon, and once/if you get hit, you’ll be as close as possible to an automatically spawned ally spirit. once defeated, you’ll earn the reduvia dagger, as well as a furlcalling finger remedy . head inside the cave, preferably with a torch , and you’ll quickly discover a site of grace. you’ll find some cave moss nearby, as well as a summoning pool statue. heading through a small tunnel, you’ll emerge into a cave with a highwayman patrolling, and another sat down on the opposite end of the room. be wary here, there are multiple tripwires in this room connected to bells which, if triggered, will summon 5 additional highwaymen from the next room. you can take cover in the brush and try to get a stealth kill, but your priority should simply be to avoid tripping the wires. heading down the path to the left, you’ll arrive in a small well-lit section with a chest. inside is a mushroom . if you didn’t trigger the tripwires in the previous section of the cave, you’ll have to eliminate the 5 highwaymen here; bottleneck them at the entrance to that section of the cave to ensure you don’t get surrounded. be careful, as these enemies (if not provoked previously), have a tendency to throw poison bombs at you, though taking one direct hit will not fill up your gauge, so close the distance fast and take them out to ensure they don’t get an opportunity to throw a follow-up. back in the main cave, there is a pathway heading right along the back wall, leading to a mist wall. traversing the mist, you’ll emerge in a large cavernous room, with a firepit and a chest in the center. opening the chest, you’ll receive cloth trousers and cloth garb and will be immediately confronted by a mysterious voice. once they are done interrogating you for your thievery, they will drop down into the arena and reveal themselves to be none other than patches - the groveling and backstabbing npc from demons souls. more of a joke encounter than anything else, patches is unlikely to prove any real threat to you. he tends to open the fight at a distance, blocking with his shield and every so often drinking from a flask and spitting the contents at you. the vapor creates an aoe cloud that lingers, so ensure you keep your distance or roll to avoid ending up in the middle of the attack. he can also jab at you with his spear, which rolling out of the way will negate the risk of. he also has a standard kick attack, though this is incredibly easy to avoid so long as you strafe whilst locked on to him. hit him a few times and you’ll note his health bar is far less grand than it seems. after a simple light attack combo, his health will hit the halfway mark, at which he will concede. hold off on your attacks and the fight will end, earning you x2 golden rune (1) and the grovel for mercy emote. patches will then discuss his status as another tarnished, and how he mistook you for a foe. you are then given the choice of forgiving him or refusing his betrayal. should you choose forgiveness, he will thank you and promise he will make a clean start as a tradesman. should you kill him, he will drop an item you can deliver to an npc at the table of lost grace to make patches items available for purchase there. to exit the dungeon quickly, look for a wispy trail of light that will teleport you back to the entrance. returning to mistwalker cave later on, you’ll indeed find patches is now selling items and equipment and has a new chest near the wispy light trail that he plays overly coy about. interacting with it enables a transporter trap that transports you to an area of western limgrave near the mistwood outskirts site of grace, occupied by giant bears. if you backtrack to murkwater cave a third time after this transportation, patches will apologize but also chastise you for snooping, earning you the calm down! emote. /n limgrave tunnels is one of the small dungeons found in the limgrave region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few treasure items and a miniboss foe. this page contains information on the location, walkthrough, and guide to traverse this dungeon, locate all of its treasure, and tips to defeat the enemies within. enemies boss notable loot stonediggers stonedigger troll smithing shards , roar medallion limgrave tunnels is found at the northern edge of agheel lake in the center part of the region, just to the south of the gatefront ruins, and northeast of the dragon-burnt ruins. approaching it from the lake will likely trigger the arrival of the great dragon agheel to appear on a spot of land near the ravine leading to the tunnels, but if you move fast enough with torrent, the dragon cannot follow you. the outside of the dungeon may include some small blob-like enemies around the edge of the lake, though sprinting through them or riding torrent ensures they won’t prove a problem. entering the limgrave tunnels you'll come upon the first of several lifts to take you down into the dungeon. should you die and resurrect after using the lift, you can always use the lever to bring it back up. at the bottom of the first lift, you'll find a site of grace, and a large mining chamber beyond. the large mining chamber here has many stonediggers hard at work, and most of them won't even notice you until you're right on top of them. you should be able to get a backstab off on several of them as they work, then harvest the smithing stone they were mining as you proceed. the stonediggers are slow to act at first and will either swing their large pickaxes or try to punch you, but these can be easily dodged and avoided so long as you don't let them group up on you, and rarely sweep with their attacks. they can also get into a string of lengthy digging attacks that are hard to interrupt and best dodged around. there are also, depending on your class, easy to parry (particularly with samurai), and the tough skin of the enemies is negated when performing critical strikes. further into the first cave room, you'll find a stonedigger watching the others, and is bound to be more alert than the diggers. this one can toss groups of rocks at you, or charge forward with its pickaxe for continuous attacks, but two-handed attacks bring it down just as quickly. be sure to look along the walls where the diggers work to find a smithing stone shard before moving to the cave floor, and double back to take out more diggers and more glintstone scrap . near the back of the chamber is a stonedigger sitting by himself, but three giant rats will come to ambush you as you try to fight him, so stay mobile and wait for their lunges to counter. clear them, and you'll find a small tunnel in the back with a body that holds a smithing stone . proceeding further into the mine, you’ll find the second lift. this will take you further down into the depths - but you may notice it will pass by a large ledge on the way down leading to a secondary tunnel -- and to the boss of this dungeon. stay on the lift for now, and upon reaching the bottom, head through the tunnel to enter a more spacious room with a wooden shack in front of you. inside is a rabid dog feasting on a corpse that holds large glintstone scrap . outside, to the right of the shack, will be two stonediggers and another rabid dog. deal with them using parries, dodges, and two-handed attacks (funnel them into the tunnel you entered the room through if necessary), and then loop around the back of the shack to find some smithing stones. backtrack through the tunnel you came from and ride the elevator back up, rolling off onto the platform halfway up mentioned earlier (you’ll be facing the correct way now to easily roll off), will lead to a sloping path filled with several more stonedigger variants. some will have bags of smoldering rocks to throw at you, and others will patrol around carrying lanterns to use as flamethrowers you'll need to dodge around and get behind them. one flamethrower will be on the right as you enter the path, so don't let him ambush you and dodge behind his flames to backstab him, then check the smaller passage he patrolled from to find a body that holds a red thorn roundshield and more glintstone scrap. proceeding down the left pathway, having cleared the stonediggers, you’ll find the third lift. head down the lift, and note on the way down there is a body on one of the small ledges on the way down, which you can jump to the right of the lift as it descends and find a golden rune . at the bottom of the third lift, you'll approach a large wooden gate that holds the boss on the other side - but first, check the area on the right to get one more smithing stone shard . the boss of this small dungeon is a troll much like the ones that wander certain areas of limgrave, and as such it behaves in a similar manner, though instead of a sword or fists, this one uses a giant club to great effect. like the stonediggers in the rest of the limgrave tunnels, you'll want to use a weapon in two hands or focus on magic attacks for this fight, as weak weapons will simply bounce off this boss and leave you reeling. similarly, many of his attacks can kill in a single hit if you aren't careful, so you'll want to be constantly moving and have stamina in reserve to dodge its huge sweeping attacks. the stonedigger troll will often begin the fight by sprinting over to slam down with a foot, before immediately following up with a huge sweeping swing, which you'll need to dodge behind and attack its back. the stomp can actually be blocked, but you'll want to avoid the sweep that follows at all costs. the troll can also try a backhanded sweep as its reorients to face you, but with less range than the club, you can backpedal to avoid it. however, if you see the troll turn to find you attacking its back and you see it raise its club, roll forward or you'll be caught in a quick downward slam. many times, the stonedigger troll will try to follow up the stomp and sweep with a rushing sweep attack - but if you make sure it's facing one of the walls of the arena during the first sweep, it will run forward and hit the wall, causing it to stagger backward and give you several free hits. as long as you don't get too greedy with these attacks, you can quickly prepare to avoid its follow-up slam when it turns around. if you also prioritize your attacks via lock-on to just one of its legs, after it rams into a wall you can actually bring it to the floor, dealing a heavy amount of damage to the troll, and further allowing you to get free hits in. sometimes this strategy (if executed well) can end the fight in under a minute. one of its more powerful attacks you'll need to watch out for is when it begins to slowly lift its club up with two hands over its head and roars. it will slam down with explosive force that sends a huge shockwave, meaning you'll want to be far away from its radius. it can also roar as it brings the club up over the side of its head, which means its preparing to launch into a string of overhead slam attacks as it moves forward toward you - and given the size of the arena, it can quickly close the distance, so you'll need to quickly dodge roll under its legs to get out of the way, or you'll risk taking massive damage - especially from its final huge shockwave slam. so long as you always have stamina in reserve to either dodge under its legs or get out of the way of its sweeps and slams, you can get a few hits in each time it slams into the wall and reset yourself until the giant stonedigger troll falls. defeating it will earn you the roar medallion , and a warp point will appear to take you back to the entrance. /n tombsward cave is one of the minor dungeons found in the limgrave region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few treasure items and a miniboss foe. this page contains information on the location, walkthrough, and guide to traverse this dungeon, locate all of its treasure, and tips to defeat the enemies within. enemies boss notable loot fungal soldiers/spore bloom plants miranda the blighted bloom poisonbloom , nomadic warrior’s cookbook , veridian amber medallion just to the southeast of the fourth church of marika in southern limgrave, there is a small drop-off. there are two levels, the bottom of which is a small wooded area. the entrance to the cave is on the middle level, denoted by a hanging brazier. heading into the cave, down the slope, you'll come across the caves site of grace. beyond the site of grace and the summoning pool, you’ll find a slope down to the right. tucked to the left before heading down is cave moss x3. you’ll find more cave moss as you keep moving through the tunnel, just before emerging into a cavern filled with poisonous liquid. there will also be some fungal soldiers patrolling; all with spears that are also capable of spellcasting. this can be a difficult room to traverse, seeming as the moment you enter your poison meter will start to build, and apply a damaging status effect once it fills. there will be a number of poisonbloom flowers you can harvest dotted around. defeating the fungal soldiers, who will often drop toxic mushroom , you’ll notice you have two paths to take as you round the corner in the cavern. it’s likely impossible for you to avoid the poison status effect taking hold so keep an eye on your health and replenish it when necessary. heading through the right passageway, you’ll enter a lower tunnel that wraps around to the right (seen in the blue circle below). around the corner, you’ll encounter three small rats and one giant rat guarding two corpses. one holds poisonbone dart x3 and the other holds nomadic warrior’s cookbook (8) . backtracking from the dead end, you’ll spot an opening on the right-hand wall (seen in the red circle in the image below) that another giant rat is likely to ambush you from. head through the opening into the room beyond and climb the slope leading up on the left. reaching the top you’ll come across 3 spore bloom plants guarding a corpse hanging over the ledge, which contains an arteria leaf. heading through the opening on the left in the main cavern (or dropping down from the ledge mentioned above), you’ll encounter two spore bloom plants, as well as three fungal soldiers in the alcove on the right, guarding a corpse holding a furlcalling finger remedy . move to the south side of the room to find a small tunnel leading down towards a mist wall. a larger version of the giant spore bloom plants that you can encounter throughout limgrave, miranda the blighted bloom is unlikely to pose too much of a threat. upon entry, you’ll emerge in a very small cave, most of which is occupied by miranda and three smaller spore bloom plants. as with other encounters with these opponents in the open world, it is best to remove the smaller plants first, which can be taken down in one hit with a weapon at +5 or higher. miranda herself only has two moves, and you will have also seen these in action before should you have encountered other spore bloom plants. the first is the general aoe poison spray that is fired into the area (which in this small cave will consume the entire zone), and is telegraphed by miranda closing her petals up and reaching into the sky before blooming and releasing the cloud. as far as is apparent, this is impossible to counter or avoid in this encounter, so just continue to wail on miranda as she winds up for this attack. the other attack, which is only likely to occur at the very beginning of your entrance to the arena, is summoning the white beams of light to shoot down from above. miranda will again rear up towards the sky, but with the petals open, as wisps of white light begin to rise around your character's radius. a second or so later, the beams will shoot down in that area dealing heavy damage. this too shouldn’t be of much concern, as you can easily dodge roll out of the impact radius at the beginning of the fight, and miranda is unlikely to repeat the move as she will resort to the aoe spray as a defensive move as you stay up close and personal. once miranda is defeated, she will drop the veridian amber medallion , and the usual wisp of light will appear to allow transport to the cave's entrance. this is recommended, as you can teleport to the entrance and dash back to the site of grace behind you to remove the likely still remaining poison debuff and fully heal you. /n deathtouched catacombs is one of the small dungeons found in the limgrave region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few treasure items and a miniboss foe. this page contains information on the location, walkthrough, and guide to traverse this dungeon, locate all of its treasure, and tips to defeat the enemies within. enemies boss notable loot skeletal warriors black knife assassin bloodrose , deathroot , assassin’s crimson dagger located in northern limgrave, just northwest of saintsbridge, and northeast of warmaster’s shack, the deathtouched catacombs can be found in the large field directly below the easternmost part of the destroyed bridge leading from stormveil castle. the easiest way to spot the doors to the catacombs is that a ghostly white figure is sitting down next to the door. heading inside and down the first set of steps, you’ll find a site of grace. moving further down, you’ll enter a room with some root resin on the floor to collect, a summoning pool and a locked door. turn left and proceed down the steps to encounter two skeletal warriors. one will be immediately in front of you, and the other will be tucked in the right-hand corner next to the doorway you just passed through. the trick with these warriors, which you are likely to have encountered elsewhere in limgrave, is that upon defeating them, they’ll fall to pieces and emit a blue wispy light. if you don’t attack them again in this state, they will resurrect and requires you to take them down once more. as such, don’t think that once you’ve initially defeated a foe you’re safe, should you forget they’ll make sure you pay for it. head down the steps on the left, and turn around to find a sheltered section underneath the walkway you were just on. there, you’ll find three additional skeletal warriors, one with a bow. the skeleton with a bow won’t awaken until you grab the grave glovewort tucked in the corner on the right, so be careful coming back out. instead of travelling down the narrow tunnel, first head to the other end of the room and defeat another two skeletal warriors and pass down the steps to enter a larger open room. inside four skeletal warriors will awaken on the ground floor, with three skeletal archers on the level above. to make this encounter easier, stick under the cover that the overhangs provide, negating any risk that the archers above might pose. defeating those on the ground floor, head to the opposite end of the room and pick up the bloodrose on the corpse just to your right, and the grave violet directly to the right of the statue. interact with the lever to open the locked doors you encountered at the start of the catacombs, but beware - two skeletons in the previous room will awaken as you enter the room with the lever, so be prepared to quickly swivel and take them down before they get the jump on you; they’ll often sprint and perform a jump attack to close the distance fast. backtrack up a floor to the room with the tunnel that you skipped earlier, and head down it. you’ll see a grave violet and a grave glovewort on the opposite end of the coffin-filled room. as you go to collect them, two skeletons will spring to life either side of the flowers. once they’re felled, make your way through the second tunnel on the left side of the room to arrive where the three skeletal archers linger. performing plenty of dodge rolls to avoid the arrows, take them down to be able to pick up the uchigatana , a powerful blade, and another grave glovewort . backtrack further to the room with the summoning pool and previously locked doors, which you can now head through and move down the stairs to a mist wall. a humanoid foe, the assassin begins the fight with depleted health. as a rule of thumb, the assassin likes to keep their distance from you. on approach, they have the tendency to do a ghostly dash backwards, meaning it’s unlikely that you’ll get more than a couple hits in at a time. the assassin will often open with a spin attack, where they press their blade to the floor and perform a 36-degree spin, finishing with a swipe. due to the overall slow movement speed of the assassin in comparison to your player character, this attack can be dodged by walking backwards. a staple move is a dash backwards or to the side, leading directly into a lunge with the blade. within a combo, this is preceded by two slashes, one left and one right. the slashes can be blocked, parried or dodge-rolled, whilst rolling is the best course of action for the lunge. be careful not to spam the dodge roll though, as there is a slight delay from the dash into the lunge so you could get caught out if you roll too early. the rest of the fight remains uneventful, resorting to a battle of attrition - get in a couple of hits before the assassin dashes away, roll out of the way of the lunges and you’ll eventually best your enemy. the only variation to be aware of is that as the assassin drops to around ⅓ of their health, the second slash prior to the dash lunge is delayed by a second or so, requiring you to correct your dodge timing - that being said, you should be close enough to finishing the fight where this won’t be encountered more than once or twice. upon defeating the assassin, they will drop the assassin’s crimson dagger . the usual wispy light that allows instant travel to the entrance of the dungeon appears, but before you leave be sure to grab the root resin in the back corners of the room, as well as opening the chest to receive deathroot . /n highroad cave is one of the small dungeons found in the limgrave region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few treasure items and a miniboss foe. this page contains information on the location, walkthrough, and guide to traverse this dungeon, locate all of its treasure, and tips to defeat the enemies within. enemies boss notable loot wolves/bats guardian golem shamshir , furlcalling finger remedy , blue dancer charm heading north past murkwater catacombs and saintsbridge, you’ll note that the canyon continues. roaming the canyon are a number of large land octopuses, so if you see those you are in the right place. unlike other dungeons, you may have come across in limgrave thus far, the entrance to this cave is very easy to miss - there are no lanterns or braziers to signal you. head as close to the sea to the north as you can within the canyon, and on the western side, you’ll see a small opening in the rock. heading inside, you’ll find a site of grace down the first tunnel, along with a summoning pool. moving down the tunnel to the right, grab the cave moss on the floor before coming up to the hole in the ground. looking down, you’ll note multiple platforms; drop down onto each one, before reaching the lower floor, again with cave moss nearby to pick up. continuing onwards, you’ll emerge into a cave with a well-lit hole in the center of the room. on the opposite side, you’ll see a wolf patrolling. ensuring you don’t fall down the pit, make your way around and deal with the wolf, who will be joined by two additional wolves from a small divet on the left-hand side. within the small divet you’ll find some more cave moss, and on the opposite side of the cave from where you entered the room will slope down to a bushy area. a wolf will ambush you from the bushes, so be prepared to dodge or block their lunge. there will also be a slightly stronger white wolf guarding a corpse containing a gold rune . backtracking to the main cavern, carefully approach the hole in the ground and you’ll again see platforms. jump or roll from platform to platform, and should you successfully land on each one before reaching the ground your health won’t be impacted. the tunnel you find yourself in splits off in two directions; to the left is a dead-end that contains some more cave moss , and the right leads to a small drop with some braziers and two wolves lying down. after taking care of them, you’ll see another option of paths. behind the barrels on the left-hand side is a long winding tunnel that eventually opens out onto a ledge with a corpse that holds arteria leaf x3. be careful, as tucked away to the left as you emerge from this tunnel is a wolf. backtracking through the tunnel and turning left to take the other path from the braziers, you’ll encounter another room full of bushes. you’ll immediately encounter two wolves who’ll try to ambush you from the brush, and in the back left corner is another wolf with a stronger white variant, along with some cave moss . heading through the right-hand side opening, you’ll emerge into an enormous cavern with stone pillars and a waterfall; you’ll also note a number of bat enemies perched in various places below you. loop around the pathway to the left and drop down to face a bat, likely attracting one or two others to fly over from across the room. once dealt with, turn around to face the direction you came and you’ll see there’s a pathway leading to a bat guarding a corpse that holds x3 smithing stone (1) . dropping down into the water of the waterfall, first turn left to pass through an opening guarded by two flying bats. beyond there is a corpse holding another smithing stone, as well as two small land octopuses. head up towards the running dropping water and two more land octopuses hide behind it, as well as a corpse holding a golden rune (4) . backtrack to the main waterfall you dropped down next to, and perform a running jump to make it across the gap and land on the collapsed pillar below. this will likely take a couple of tries, so try to line up your run properly, and jump at the last possible second to ensure you land on the edge of the pillar enough so that you don’t fall off as you recover from the landing. in the center, you’ll find two bats guarding a corpse containing the shamshir curved sword, but be alert as any surviving bats that were perched on the pillars above will begin to fly down and face you here. you now have two paths to choose from, both requiring a small amount of platforming. first, head up the steps to the left, jump to the broken pillar stump, then jump again to reach the area with the brazier. kill the land octopus on the steps to the right, and collect the cave moss next to the pathway leading up on the left-hand side. at the top of the path, you’ll enter a room with a large land octopus hanging from the ceiling. once you enter, it will drop down and you’ll need to defeat it, as well as two smaller ones on the left. with them defeated, head through the small tunnel tucked away on the right-hand side of the room to eventually emerge back into the main chamber next to a corpse that holds a furlcalling finger remedy . whilst you can backtrack from here, a shortcut to bypass the other platforming route mentioned earlier is to head to the left-hand side of the ledge you’re on (the side by the waterfall) and carefully drop down onto the rocks below being hit by the water, then hugging the wall and turning left to head down a slope. you’ll now be in a water-filled room with 5 or 6 silver firefly on the right. at the other end of the room is a mist wall. a large stone opponent, the golem is laid down as you enter the arena but will quickly get to its feet and start swinging. there are two optimum strategies for dealing with the golem, depending on your build. if you are a ranged fighter, you’ll need a lot of well-timed dodge rolls, and if you’re melee-focused you’ll need to constantly be on the move. the best area to focus on attacking is the golem’s legs, as dealing enough damage to them can cause the golem to fall and become vulnerable to a critical strike in its chest. the majority of the golems attacks revolve around the use of its axe. at a medium to long distance, the golem will sweep his axe left to right, and right to left, with the second sweep extending much further. due to the size restrictions of the arena, this second sweep will almost always require a dodge roll to avoid. the golem can also follow up the sweeps with a flaming breath attack that, similar to flying dragon agheel, will track your position. it can be very difficult to evade this attack if you’re melee-focused, so sprint away if you can - dodge rolling often tends to be too slow. unlike agheel however, if you get caught in the flames it is unlikely to kill you if your health is high enough. this firebreathing attack has a variant that occurs if you spend too much time in between the golem's feet. with this variation, the golem breathes fire as it leans over and walks backward. the fire doesn’t spread too far behind itself however, so stick to its backside and roll where necessary. a concern specifically for melee builds, the golem will aggressively defend its feet. it does this by slamming the hilt of its axe into the ground multiple times in front of itself, each time creating small shockwaves. this plays out as a 7 move combo, with two sets of 3 quick successive ground pounds, and the final one coming a split-second after the penultimate one. rest assured that these tend to be easy to avoid if you don’t get overconfident in the number of attacks you perform before stepping back; if you do get caught in one slam, dodge-roll to the side and you should be out of the impact radius for the successive strikes (as the golem tends to step backward with each strike). the golem can also perform one of these ground slams but takes a long wind up to do so. as such, unless you’re right up close, it’s unlikely to affect you. the shockwave is larger, but with how telegraphed the attack is you should have plenty of time to get away. be wary though, after bringing the axe down in this attack, the golem will pull the hilt of the axe out of the ground, creating a similarly sized shockwave - so don’t rush in again straight away to start attacking. similarly, the golem heavily telegraphs an overhead slam with the axe, slowly raising it into the air above its head and bringing it down. this is the attack that creates the largest shockwave, and tends to be directed towards the center of the arena, so when you see the golem winding up head to the outskirts of the arena to escape the blast. a final attack to be aware of is the golem’s tendency to side-swipe if you stay at its sides too long. whilst the swipe with the axe can be performed on its own, it’s often performed after a hilt slam as the most common time for the golem to perform this attack is when you charge him from the front and dodge to the side. after defeating the golem, either through natural chipping away at health or getting to perform a critical strike, the golem will drop the blue dancer charm as a wispy light appears to transport you back to the entrance of the cave when you choose. /n impaler’s catacombs is one of the minor dungeons found in the limgrave region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few treasure items and a miniboss foe. this page contains information on the location, walkthrough, and guide to traverse this dungeon, locate all of its treasure, and tips to defeat the enemies within. enemies boss notable loot fanged imps/zombies erdtree burial watchdog prattling pate: “please help” , demi-human ashes at the northeastern point of south limgrave, just southeast of the bridge of sacrifice, is a small slope leading down the eastern side of the cliff face. the area at the bottom is dotted with tombstones, and guarded by jellyfish. buried in the cliff face to the left is the double doors leading down the steps to the site of grace. down the stairs past the site of grace, you’ll see a set of stairs with a chasm to the left. as you enter the room, a fanged imp will climb up from the chasm so be wary if you rush in as you could get attacked from behind. alternatively, slowly enter and you will have the opportunity to attack it and likely push it back into the chasm to die. halfway down the steps you’ll find a grave violet plant, and at the base of the stairs will be a second fanged imp; most likely throwing daggers from this range. within the room ahead you’ll find the locked doors and a summoning pool. turn left and head down the corridor to encounter three fanged imps. to your left, you’ll find a grave glovewort (1) on top of a coffin. continuing on, you’ll find a fork in the path. continuing straight and turn left to find a room with one fanged imp and a grave glovewort (1) plant. backtrack and head down the path on your left-hand side to arrive at a large open room. be extremely cautious here, as the floor acts as a pressure plate that triggers the entire ground to rise and lift you into the spikes on the ceiling. it will rise slowly, stop for a second, then slam the rest of the distance into the spikes. if you trigger the trap, you can sprint and roll over into the alcove on the left to grab a grave violet . then sprint back to the entrance of the room, trigger the trap and pull back into the hallway. this allows you to get underneath the floor as it's rising, so drop down and grab the grave violet in the corner to your left, and the ghost glovewort (2) near the passageway. heading through the tunnel you’ll encounter some shambling zombie-like humanoids. these will continue to respawn if killed, so keep moving (or use them as a form of rune farm if you aren’t in a rush). be sure to grab the various grave glovewort plants dotted aside some of the pillars, and loot the corpse for the prattling pate: “please help” . turn right and you’ll spot an alcove to the left with a corpse that holds some root resin , though be aware that 4 of the zombies will emerge from the ground near this alcove. across the room to your right you’ll spot a ladder, which you’ll want to sprint to as around a dozen of the zombies spawn so it becomes very easy to get surrounded and overwhelmed. at the top of the ladder, you’ll emerge next to the lever to open the locked doors earlier on. head onwards and a fanged imp will spring from around the corner by the grave glovewort plant. at the end of the corridor is a window opening, and by jumping through you arrive back at the locked doors, which are now open and lead down to the mist wall. another stone cat-like statue, the erdtree burial watchdog wields a large blade and its multiple heads are keen to spew fire all over you. this fight is almost identical in structure to the burial tree watchdog fight in stormfoot catacombs , with a few minor exceptions. the most obvious is that upon entering the combat arena, the watchdog is joined by four fanged imps. the best strategy is to focus on these first, as they can become an increasing thorn in your side the more the fight goes on. circle around the outskirts of the room to try and keep the watchdog behind the pillars. close the distance with any remaining imps to prevent them from throwing daggers, and once all of them are dealt with turn to face the watchdog. it is a large stone statue with a big sword and fire-tipped tail, and will move fairly slowly much of the time as it sit on its haunches. however, it can suddenly extend its height by standing on its hind legs and cross to you quicker than you might expect to attack, or even float across the room to crash down on you, so be ready for a multitude of attacks don't be fooled, as it can quickly lower its sword to thrust forward with decent range, or raise the sword high to slash down vertically, diagonally, or horizontally. if it slams its sword down to the side, it means that the boss is about to launch a spinning attack, which is your cue to backpedal out of range. many of its swings do take a few moments to charge up and cool down, giving you a brief chance to get some hits in of your own before waiting for its next attack. use these chances wisely and do not get greedy or deplete your stamina early, as you'll need to be ready to get away at a moment's notice. some of its more powerful attacks include when its head begins to start shaking wildly, as it will soon start pivoting to face you while spewing fire in your direction, meaning you'll either have to strafe quickly or back off and used ranged attacks while its stuck in the animation. this fire attack, in comparison to the burial tree watchdog , has a wider radius so dodging backwards is likely your best bet. when it decides to stand up tall, it will try to approach you can slam down its sword vertically at a fairly quick rate, but a well-timed dodge can leave it open to a counter-attack. the watchdog can also float into the air, which should tell you to be extremely careful. it will rise into the air as it moves toward you, before slamming into the ground sword first to send out a shockwave. the worst part about this move is that it can do this multiple times, and you'll need to dodge in rapid succession to avoid getting slammed. stay on the defensive until it stops rising back into the air, and let your stamina reset before engaging it again. if using ranged or magic attacks, always wait until after its strikes to backpedal and let loose some of your own, or you might be caught mid-animation by its quick sword lunge or downward slams. since it is fairly slow, you can usually keep out of range of its telegraphed attacks. upon defeating the watchdog, it will drop the demi-human ashes . /n earthbore cave is one of the minor dungeons found in the limgrave region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few treasure items and a miniboss foe. this

spelldrake talisman , pickled turtle neck x3 west from the bridge of sacrifice in south limgrave, northwest through the forest from south of the lookout tower, you’ll note a slope leading down to the riverside just west of the large stone structure ruin. alternatively, upon approaching through the forest, you can interact with a glowing white rune rod that creates a gold spectral husk that, should you follow it, leads you to the entrance of the cave. when you see the brazier, you’ll know you’ve reached the cave. heading inside you’ll find a site of grace. by heading beyond the site of grace, you’ll spot a chest and some cave moss in the corner to the left. if you approach it, the floor will collapse and you’ll land amongst 5 rats and a giant rat. heading through the cavern to the left (denoted by a blue-ish white light) you’ll face two small rats guarding two corpses: one holds glowstone , and the other kukri x5. there is another drop behind the rats, but backtrack for now. head to the western corner of the cave you fell into to head up a slope. a corpse there holds golden rune (1) and some cave moss , and further up you’ll find more cave moss and the summoning pool. continuing up, you’ll arrive by the chest near the entrance, which holds pickled turtle neck x3. head back to the drop you bypassed and you’ll spot a platform hugging the side you’re dropping down from. land on it, then fall further to land in shallow water. grab the several silver firefly on the wall to the left, then proceed down the tunnel. the runebear is similar to the large bears roaming mistwood in west limgrave, and is recommended to be tackled with a weapon with at least +5 levels. it relies mostly on lunges and swipes, often attempting to bear hug you in a bellyflop move that deals devastating amounts of damage. as a rule of thumb, as intimidating as it might seem, it’s a good idea to stick close to the bear to enable dodge-rolls underneath one of its arms as it swipes, which also often works as a counter to the lunge attacks so long as you roll diagonally underneath and outwards. focusing on the hind legs of the bear will allow you to stagger it when it reaches around 50% health, causing the bear to collapse and permitting a critical strike on its head. if you are struggling to dodge or keep the bear from hounding you, using an ash like wandering nobles or demi-human (or any that summons multiple additional targets for the bear) can help you gain a little breathing room. the bear also, after rushing away to a corner of the room, can perform a charge that knocks you to the floor. this is dodgeable in the same way you would dodge the swipes - dodge rolling diagonally - though this can be harder to pull off. rest assured though, the bear very often has enough time to wind up a follow-up attack before you have the chance to recover. any fire spells or imbuements you have to hand are also especially useful in this fight, as the bear takes more damage to that effect than any other. upon defeating the bear, it will drop the spelldrake talisman , and the corpses against the back wall (and the teleport wisp) hold some smouldering butterfly and a trina’s lily . /n castle morne is one of the minor dungeons found in the limgrave region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few treasure items and a miniboss foe. this page contains information on castle morne, walkthrough, and guide to traverse this dungeon, locate all of its treasure, and tips to defeat the enemies within. you’ll need to visit castle morne to complete irina’s letter delivery request. enemies boss notable loot misbegotten/godrick knights leonine misbegotten grafted blade greatsword , whip , stonesword key at the southernmost point of south limgrave, castle morne is very hard to miss. upon your first approach, a large golem will fire ballista ammunition at you from a great distance, often able to take you by surprise and lead to some sudden deaths. make good use of the terrain and broken structures lining the path to the castle to avoid the fire, and swipe at the golem's legs to take it down permanently. heading inside, you'll find a site of grace just beyond the steps on the left past the portcullis. as you take the lift just beyond the site of grace, you'll rise up a set of steps into a large open courtyard. roaming the giant pile of corpses on the right are a number of misbegotten and a number of feral dogs. around each of the fires in the courtyard, you can find multiple smoldering butterfly , and the corpse on the ruins to the left of the highest fire contains fire grease . on the opposite side of the courtyard to where you entered, you'll find a resting pumpkin head enemy. tucked in the alcove to the left of the tree it is resting by, there will be a corpse holding a smithing stone (1) . to the right, you'll find a ladder hugging the wall on the right-hand side. climb it to face two additional misbegotten, as well as two flying misbegotten who fire arrows from the air. halfway across the bridge, on the right, you'll find a corpse holding a golden rune (1) . alternatively, you can loop behind the giant pile of corpses and head inside a darkened room on the right. immediately to your left, behind a wooden palette, is a chest containing a claymore weapon. head down the steps to the right, and you'll encounter two misbegotten fighting a godrick knight. head up the ladder on the left to stumble upon a large battle between misbegotten and godrick knights; upon clearing the space there will be a corpse on the right side of the gallows in the southeast corner that holds a furlcalling finger remedy . to the northeast is a small pathway guarded by two misbegotten, and a corpse that holds the steel-wire torch . in the western corner is a ladder, and after climbing it you will have looped around and can drop down to the same bridge and continue progress. across the bridge, you'll find a brazier with more smoldering butterfly . to the right of the brazier, the wall of the tower has been destroyed, allowing you to drop down to a site of grace. continue to drop down and you can either drop down to the left, where a corpse holding a stonesword key is on a wooden platform (which is recommended), or you can jump across the gap between rooftops and drop down through the gap in the grated ceiling. in the room below (should you drop through the grate in the ceiling or through the door if you collected the stonesword key), there will be a misbegotten in the corner, as well as a spirit in a cage and a corpse that holds a golden rune (3) . passing over the bridge, defeating the larger axe-wielding misbegotten on the other side. head up the ladder on the left-hand side to reach a small circular watchtower, tucked around the back of which is a chest containing the twinblade talisman . backtracking to the bridge, drop down on the right-hand side to land on the roof below. dropping down further, a corpse behind the tree holds x3 tarnished golden sunflower . jump down to the left, where you'll be able to see buildings down to the beach. approach the hole in the ceiling and drop down, landing on the wooden beam. grab the smithing stone from the corpse, then drop down further to face 4 rats and a misbegotten. at the back of the room is a corpse holding the whip weapon. head outside and round the corner to the left to find a site of grace. crossing over the wooden bridge, a large axe-wielding misbegotten is resting to your immediate left, whilst a flying misbegotten will descend and attack you as well. before heading down the ladder on the right, grab the throwing dagger x8 from the corpse against the southwestern wall. after descending the ladder, head north around the left side of the building across the water to find some small crabs. be careful, as a giant crab will begin to emerge as you take out the smaller ones; though if you start attacking as it emerges, the crab is unlikely to be able to begin attacking before you can kill it. with that dealt with, continue north to find a small crevasse in the rock face guarded by two more small crabs. within the crevasse is a corpse holding fire arrow x8. heading south, under the bridge and slightly out into the water, you'll spot an arch and a mist wall within. a humanoid beast with a red mane and a large sword, this foe is an agile fighter. if you’ve spoken to irina’s father, edgar, you can summon him to help you in this fight. capable of closing short distances very quickly, efficient and conservative use of your stamina bar will be key to your success. one of its main attacks is a four-move combo, involving three swings back and forth with its sword, finishing with an overhead vertical slam. again, with the speed of this opponent, it will be very difficult to keep any kind of distance between the two of you, so dodge-rolling through the swings and away from the slam are essential. if you're confident in parrying, you can interrupt any of the swings bar the final slam so attempt to get a critical strike there if you think you can execute the timing. it can also get on all fours and launch towards you with a swing, then a 360-degree spin into a launch into the air and stabbing its sword into the ground. the stab with the sword has a lock-on that is best countered by staying underneath the beast as it's in the air and rolling at the last second; your i-frames will help with the resulting shockwave. the beast can swipe with its left hand back and forth, then jump into the air, grab both ends of its sword and slam it down creating a larger shockwave, which is easy to avoid by rolling backward as the sword hits the ground. also be aware that the beast can roar, which will damage you slightly and can even stagger you if your build isn't dexterous enough. with dashing swipes at longer distances, the beast is best faced aggressively. a brutal move to watch out for at close range is a foot stomp, that immediately leads into two 360-degree spins with the sword. this above any other attack in this fight has the highest chance of killing you outright, as if you get caught during the first spin you will be hit by the second. you can block the foot stomp with minor impact on your stamina, but be prepared to immediately execute two dodge-rolls to evade the swings. whilst the beast can strike very fast, most of its moves are telegraphed relatively well and therefore this is a battle of attrition above all else. due to its speed, it is heavily recommended to not get greedy with attacks of any kind, and whittle down its health until you best it. upon defeating the leonine misbegotten, it will drop the grafted blade greatsword weapon, and a new site of grace will emerge in the center of the arena for easy traversal back to the mainland. /n morne tunnel is one of the minor dungeons found in the limgrave region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few

enemies boss notable loot harpies scaly misbegotten rusted anchor , soft cotton , arteria leaf in southern limgrave, just to the east of the minor erdtree, there will be a large canyon. at the bottom of the canyon, tucked into the cliff face at the southern end, will be a mine entrance. you'll know you're in the right place spotting a brazier next to the cliff face. if you're close to the wooden drawbridge overhead, you're in the wrong spot. move more towards the largely destroyed stone bridge columns and you'll spot the brazier and the entrance. passing through, you'll arrive at a lift, which once ridden down, will deliver you in front of a site of grace. after descending the lift, you'll arrive in front of the site of grace. activate it and proceed through the tunnel beyond. you'll emerge into a large mining cave, with a harpy likely attacking you as you arrive. below you'll see a number of other harpies, as well as one sleeping on the platform to the right. follow the path left and jump across to the ladder, at the top of which is a stonedigger mining some smithing stone (1). head back down the ladder, jump across the gap on the left and defeat the sleeping harpy. proceed through the tight tunnel on the left to reach another cavern, with descending stairs. down the first flight you'll face 3 harpies; one awake and two sleeping. a corpse on the right of the platform holds a golden rune (1). to the left, in an alcove, there will be another stonedigger and a smithing stone (1) . heading southeast another stonedigger is mining a smithing stone (1) . you'll notice you have two paths to choose from now: one to the south of this cavern next to the second stonedigger, and another path leading under the platform you just descended from. heading down the path by the second stonedigger, you'll arrive at a wooden shack. to the left and right of the shack is stonediggers; the left one being a variant that throws stones from its backpack. inside the shack will be another stonedigger, as well as a corpse holding a golden rune (4) , and a chest that holds exalted flesh . around the back of the shack is a somber smithing stone (2). looping round further behind the right side of the shack is an alcove with a stonedigger and a corpse holding a large glintstone scrap . backtracking out to the previous cavern, head towards the path underneath the platform to face two more stonediggers, as well as a smithing stone (1) on the wall and a corpse holding stanching boluses . move down the tunnel and you'll arrive at the ground floor you were looking down upon as you first entered the dungeon. whilst there are multiple stonediggers in this room, it's best to deal with the harpies on the right first, particularly the one with wings, as they are far more aggressive and hard to handle in comparison. the corpse the harpies are guarding holds an arteria leaf . there are a number of smithing stones in the room, all being mined by the stonediggers, as well as a somber smithing stone in an alcove in the center back wall, guarded by a harpy. you will again have two paths here: a tunnel leading to the left, and one in the far back right of the room. the tunnel to the left leads to a small alcove with a corpse holding soft cotton . the tunnel on the right leads to a large wooden gate acting as a boss door. before proceeding through it, be sure to grab the somber smithing stone in the far right corner of the room. a somewhat unassuming boss, the scaly misbegotten is in reality the exact same foe you will have encountered in south limgrave - a larger axe-wielding harpy. all of the moves from this foe are slow and heavily telegraphed, meaning that avoiding them should be simple; being caught by one though can deal tremendous damage. using any spirit ashes during this fight to draw aggro off you can make the whole encounter trivial. spellcasters in general should have no issue vanquishing this foe, often even before they can reach you in the arena. the attack patterns are limited, and again are identical in form to other axe-wielding harpies. a slow wind-up swing back and forth, as well as a lunging swing with a larger build-up prior to launching. a attack that the scaly misbegotten doesn't often use, but can take you by surprise as a result, is after what appears to be the usual two-swipe combo, it will raise its axe into the air and vertically slam it down. the positive is that the slam doesn't create a shockwave as it hits the floor, so as long as you dodge the blade it won't impact you. after defeating the scaly misbegotten, it will drop the rusted anchor weapon. /n tombsward catacombs is one of the minor dungeons found in the limgrave region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few

enemies boss notable loot harpies cemetery shade nomadic warrior's cookbook 9 , lhutel the headless spirit ashes this dungeon is particularly easy to miss. just to the north of the minor erdtree, you'll spot on the slope down heading north is a stone arch lead up against the cliff face. this is not down on the level of the tombsward ruins, but instead a level above. if you're on that ground level, look for two large standing stone pillars directly next to one another, and the double doors to enter the catacombs will be just to the east (and upwards) from them. heading through the doors, down the first flight of stairs you'll find a site of grace. moving down past the site of grace, you'll spot a fork in the path. to the right, is an imp seal, and to the left is a staircase leading down. should you open the imp seal with a stonesword key , two skeletons will animate in the room. a swordsman in the back left corner and a shieldsman in the immediate right corner. as with other skeleton enemies in the game, ensure you strike them again once defeated to prevent them from reanimating. loot the corpse in the room for the nomadic warrior's cookbook 9 . head back out and turn right down the staircase, you'll arrive at the locked doors and summoning pool. turn left through the passageway and you'll be in a square room with a large column in the middle. tucked around the left-hand side is a skeleton who will throw fire bombs until you get up close and personal. around the back of the column (the opposite side to which you entered the room) another skeleton will animate next to the grave glovewort (2) plant. there is also a grave glovewort (1) plant on the right side of the room. continuing onwards, you'll pass down a staircase and enter a room with multiple floors on the opposite side. to your right, a skeleton will animate next to a grave glovewort (1) plant. across the room, two skeleton archers will also spawn so ensure you take cover in the right corner and dodge roll on approach to avoid getting hit. in the sheltered portion of the room by the skeleton archers is a ghost glovewort (1) . along the left side of the room you'll spot another passageway. defeat the skeleton that patrols there, then grab the grave glovewort (1) . in the furthest back alcove on the right of this room, a skeleton with a shield will spring to life. continue through the passageway and as you turn the corner you'll encounter a fire trap. wait for the flames to die down then sprint down the corridor and take shelter in the alcove on the right. a skeleton with a shield will spawn there so ensure you defeat it to not get caught out. when safe, loot the corpse in the corridor for human bone shard x5. sprint to the fire trap and dodge to the left, then strike the trap to lower it and allow easy traversal back and forth. in the back corner of the room you'll find a grave violet plant as well as a skeleton animating. you'll then enter a small room with a grave glovewort (2) plant and a corpse holding prattling pate (thank you) . be careful here; as soon as you enter, a skeleton will spawn in each corner of the room, four in total, and can easily overwhelm you. it can prove useful to back out into the corridor to funnel the skeletons slightly and reduce the chances of you getting surrounded. with them defeated, return to the fire trap and strike it again to cause it to rise, and as it begins to do so, jump atop it to ride up to the higher platform (as seen in the image below). there is a firebombing skeleton on this platform so be careful and ready to block/roll/heal as required. the corpse next to the skeleton holds a golden rune (4). pass through the corridor and you'll enter another square room with a column in the middle. to the left, you'll find a grave violet plant. head through the opening on the other side of the room to face off two skeletons: an archer at the far end of the room and a swordsman near the entrance. by a coffin at the far end is a grave glovewort (2) . turning right, you'll spot the lever at the end of the corridor. pull it and grab the grave violet to the left before rolling off and backtracking to the previously locked doors. once there, head down the steps to reach the mist wall. this cemetery shade is identical in form and strategy to the one you encounter in the black knife catacombs and caelid catacombs . it is a black spectral creature, harnessing fast-striking blades and immobilizing spit. like its brethren, the shade is extremely vulnerable to melee damage, incentivizing getting up close and personal - which is the risk-reward as the shade can teleport instantly and its flurry of blade attacks in a 3-phase combo come so quickly it's nigh-on impossible to parry or fully block. the main attack to look out for is the aforementioned spit. the shade will summon a green oozing sphere above its head and then fires it at you which, should it make contact, will completely immobilize you for a few seconds. this allows the shade to come up to you and begin gnawing at your face, dealing devastating amounts of damage. the best way to counter this is to spawn in spirits, particularly aggressive ones in groups ie lone wolf ashes, to draw the shade's attention and allow you to deal heavy damage, often finishing the fight before the wolves can be killed. it is helpful to have a weapon with at least +4 to make light work of the shade. upon defeating the cemetery shade, you'll receive the lhutel the headless ashes . before you leave, be sure to grab the three root resin on the floor along the back wall of the arena. /n fringefolk hero’s grave is one of the minor dungeons found in the limgrave region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few

enemies boss notable loot spectral soldiers ulcerated tree spirit poisonbone dart , golden rune (5) , dragonwound grease , golden seed, banished knight oleg ashes in the starting area, next to the stranded graveyard site of grace, you’ll note a imp seal requiring a stonesword key . transferring a key removes the mist wall and allows you to descend the ladder to the right to enter the dungeon. as you descend the ladder, you’ll note that the floor is a bubbling green liquid that will poison you upon contact. as soon as you hit the floor, sprint to the end of the corridor and turn right (rolling if you have to), to reach safety before the poison meter fills completely and applies a lasting damaging effect. as you move down the corridor, wait and a giant mechanical chariot will emerge from the slope, which will stop, turn around and ride back down the slope. it will repeat this motion for the remainder of this section of the dungeon, so be sure to keep an eye on it as it is a one-hit kill if it touches you. your goal is to maneouvre between the alcoves lining the sides of the slope, alternating as the chariot moves up and down. in the second set of alcoves on the slope, a spectral crossbow wielder is in the left alcove. in the third set of alcoves, a spirit with a sword and shield is in the left alcove while another crossbowman is in the right alcove. head down and turn right, but keep sprinting down the next slope into an alcove as the chariot then transitions to this slope instead, so can easily catch you from behind if you aren’t moving fast. it’s actually nigh-on impossible to outrun the chariot if you take the path naturally, so instead, roll off the edge of the lower right alcoves on the first slope to get a headstart on the chariot as you cross over the section of the slope with a chasm either side. the corpse on this section holds golden rune (5) . at the bottom of the second slope, after turning left, you have two paths: a slope up to the right, or a slope down to the left. heading up and to the right, you'll have enough time to run into one of the alcoves or even to sprint up around the corner if you're feeling brave. this section acts as an l-shaped track for the chariot, riding up the slope you're climbing, turning the corner, riding up to the top, and then all the way back down. every time you see an alcove, take cover in it as being greedy here will leave you dead without fail. at the top, you'll pass through a small tunnel and face off against a larger spectral enemy. whilst not a boss, it is incredibly aggressive. your best bet is dodge-rolling behind it as it finishes a combo to get a critical strike, or if you're feeling brave, you can lure it out into the corridor and allow the chariot to hit it, but that'll require you to ensure it doesn't hit you as well. defeating the spirit will earn you the dragon communion seal , and the corpse on the floor holds dragonwound grease . backtracking and heading down the slope that's to the left from the fork in the road, two spirits - one with sword and shield, one with a crossbow - are in the first alcove on the right. the corpse slightly lower down the slope on the left holds grave glovewort (1) . as you run down (which is easily accomplishable if you shortcut the chariot with the method mentioned earlier), 4 spirits will appear in the center of the walkway; 3 swordsmen and one crossbowman. these can be easily bypassed by running past them and taking the right at the bottom of the slope to meet a mist wall. identical to other tree spirits that you can encounter throughout the lands between, this boss can be incredibly difficult if you are under-leveled. with this dungeon technically being accessible right at the beginning of the game, you'd think the boss would be manageable. you thought wrong. this tree spirit, like the others, is a highly aggressive, incredibly fast-moving enemy and due to its size, it can be very easy to have the game's camera turn on you, particularly if lock-on is used. the tree spirit often has long wind-ups to its attacks but executes them very quickly so can take you by surprise. an example would be the chain of lunging bites that it performs, where it retreats to the opposite side of the arena, and will swing its mouth left and right 3 times, each time requiring a well-placed dodge. as a rule of thumb, you'll want to try and stick to the sides of the boss, rather than the back, as this is the most effective place to dodge-roll out of many of its attacks, including 180-degree spins with its tail. the spirit can also perform a number of fire attacks, be it breathing fire in front of itself as it moves in a line across the arena, or a grab attack where it rears back and quickly lunges forward to grab you with its mouth, subsequently breathing fire on you as you're there, before slamming you to the ground. a major fire-based attack to be extremely cautious of is when the spirit begins to emanate flames all over its body in a yellow aura before exploding out in a large sphere. if you see the spirit begin this animation, sprint or dodge-roll as far away as possible to avoid being blown off your feet and taking extensive damage. swipes with its arms are often followed up immediately with tail swings, so be ready for quick follow-up attacks throughout this encounter. as you're sticking to the sides of the boss, the main attack to watch out for is stomps it performs with its arms. once defeated, the ulcerated tree spirit will drop a golden seed and the banished knight oleg ashes . /n elden ring features a large variety of different types of dungeons, and unlike previous from software titles, most of these dungeons are entirely optional, and serve as side content to

is home to a few treasure items and a miniboss foe. this page contains information on the location, walkthrough, and guide to traverse this dungeon, locate all of its treasure, and tips to defeat the enemies within. enemies boss notable loot fungal soldiers/miranda flowers/bats cleanrot knight sage robe , sage hood , sage trousers , winged sword insignia located in southern liurnia, head very briefly due north from the lake-facing cliffs site of grace (likely the first you'll encounter in liurnia due to its proximity to stormveil castle), and tucked away amongst the trees in the south end of the lake is the cave entrance. you'll know where to head as two jellyfish are patrolling the area right next to the entrance, and a giant lobster will often spring from the ground. after curving around the rock to enter the cave, head down the tunnel to activate the site of grace. beyond the site of grace, head down the slope to enter a cavern with miranda flowers in the lowered area to the left. grab the golden rune (3) off of the corpse hanging off the ledge, and grab the crystal cave moss and cave moss looping around the corner. continue around the upper level and face a bat in the alcove to the right, along with some more cave moss to collect. beyond you'll face a fungal soldier who will cast poisonous projectiles that slowly make their way towards you. after eliminating the sorcerer, you'll note two more across the gap, at the bottom of which are more miranda plants and fungal soldiers. you can actually perform a running jump across this gap to face them, or lure them to jump across by running back and hiding in the alcove where the bat was. after clearing this upper level, jump across and head down the tunnel to collect some budding cave moss , and further on some crystal cave moss as the tunnel opens into a smaller cave. inside is a harpy as well as two more bats. they are likely to have a golden rune (5) on their corpses, so be sure to collect them. the corpse on the right holds serpent arrows . the corpse in the center of a deep pool of poison holds the sage hood , sage robe , and sage trousers . the pool heavily slows your movement and so you are likely to become poisoned, as such it is recommended to running jump to the corpse rather than wade in, then jump out as fast as possible. keep this in mind if you're low on crimson tear flasks. as you backtrack out, there is actually a continuation of the upper path curving around to your left, where there will be three bats to face, as well as fungal soldiers casting the poison spells back and to the right. in the corner where the bats came from you'll find a couple of budding cave moss plants, as well as a corpse containing glowstone . perform another running jump across the gap to the west (jumping over a large miranda flower), and head towards the tunnel sloping down to your left. there you'll face two more fungal soldiers with a poisonbloom plant to your right near a drop-off. drop down, and run (as quickly as possible to capitalize on the fact that your poison meter won't continue to go up once maximized) and kill the 5 fungal soldiers lining the path. drop off the end and collect the poisonbloom and the poison grease off the corpse to the right, and then proceed through the mist wall on the left. a knight wielding a sword and a spear, this fight can prove to be a difficult one if you are underprepared. it is recommended to have a weapon of at least +6 to expedite the fight and limit the amount of poison damage you'll take, as well as having a few neutralizing boluses in your inventory to remove/reset the poison meter as it inevitably builds over the course of the fight. if possible, it is recommended to stick to the left side of the arena, as it is solid ground away from the poisonous waters, and therefore can negate the possibility of your poison meter maxing out. having to keep an eye on your declining health is one more problem than you need. whilst this does limit the space you have to fight the knight, so long as you ration your stamina bar you should be able to carefully dodge around most of its attacks. the cleanrot knight can swipe with its sword, lunge with its spear, and cross the two together in front of itself to protect against your attacks. whilst these moves can cause issues, they can be easily parried or dodged. the issues arise when the knight begins to use magic to imbue its attacks. the three main magical attacks the knight performs are as follows; a powered up lunge with the spear that the knight charges you with. the timing to counter this is difficult to place, and later than you'd think. if caught, it pierces you and raises you into the air, dealing heavy damage and applying the scarlet rot status effect. the second magical attack is if you continue to swipe at it at close range whilst it is crossing the sword and spear, it can blast magical energy outwards. this blast has a very small aoe, so as long as you don't get greedy with your attacks and get caught mid-animation, you can easily roll out of the blast radius. the final magical attack is where the knight swipes its spear along the floor 90 degrees whilst dashing backwards. the area the spear swiped over will then begin to glow, shortly after which spectral spears will shoot from the floor. aside from the magical spear lunge, this attack is the most devastating damage wise. upon defeating the cleanrot knight, you'll earn the winged sword insignia . /n cliffbottom catacombs is one of the minor dungeons found in the liurnia region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few treasure items and a miniboss foe. this page contains information on the location, walkthrough, and guide to traverse this dungeon, locate all of its treasure, and tips to defeat the enemies within. enemies boss notable loot fanged imps/trolls erdtree burial watchdog nox mirrorhelm , scythe , prattling pate (wonderful) , kaiden sellsword ashes on the eastern side of liurnia, just north of liurnia highway south, you’ll find a long stretching slope heading south. as you head down, you’ll encounter a large number of vulgar militia who ambush from the shadows and/or bushes with leaping axe attacks. about halfway down the slope, you’ll note on the right hand side (the side of the rockface), there is a small incline heading back north. there you’ll find the double doors buried in the cliffface, with a site of grace just one flight of stairs down. as you head down past the site of grace, you’ll ride a lift down into the tombs. head forward to face a room with two fanged imps. one in the center of the room and one immediately to your right as you enter. grab the root resin from across the room and the grave violet on the left next to the stairs leading down. down the steps you’ll find the locked doors and a summoning pool. turn right down the next set of steps and turn left to face another imp, this time wielding a two-handed weapon. whilst this results in heavier blows if you get hit, you can take advantage of the longer wind-ups to perform critical strikes against it. proceeding down the hallway, grab the grave glovewort (2) and down the steps in the room beyond, being careful not to drop off the edges. continue straight down the hallway, ensuring you avoid the pressure plate in the center of the walkway; if triggered a spectral arrows will fire from the end of the hallway in 3 bursts (which can be dodge-rolled). a fanged imp will also drop down from the ceiling to face you, so ensure to not backstep onto the pressure plate should you need to retreat and create some space. at the end of the hallway there is a right turn, and as you arrive an imp will spring from the corner and attack you. once defeated, it will drop the forked hatchet weapon. you’ll emerge in a room with a staircase to the left and a sheltered portion at the back of the room on the right. in the sheltered portion, a very aggressive troll lies asleep, which will awake when approached. the only item of note worth venturing there for is a ghost glovewort (3) plant against the back wall. should you aggro the troll, be conservative with your attacks, and dodge-roll everything. at the end of its combos, which often end in a kick followed by an axe sweep, you have an opportunity to get in behind it and critical strike. up the steps on the right side of the room, you’ll note a stonesword key locked path straight ahead, as well as another troll patrolling to the right. should you unlock the path (if you have a stonesword key), a fanged imp will drop from the ceiling and attack you, and a corpse on the back wall holds the nox mirrorhelm helmet. the troll can be snuck past if you monitor its patrol path, but be wary of two fanged imps on the platform above you. you can also avoid making them hostile, just stick to the left wall as you climb the stairs and head to the passageway beyond. the room at the end of the small tunnel you pass through has a pressure plate right in the entryway, so you will have to carefully skirt around it or dodge-roll to avoid the volleys. two fanged imps are also in this room, so be careful to not get overwhelmed with their blood loss inducing attacks, and also not to trigger the trap by accident. in the alcove of the room, you’ll find grave glovewort (2). be careful, as you can also lure the troll from the floor below with your fight against these imps, so try to lure them down the corridor further into the catacombs rather than back the way you came. through the corridor you’ll arrive at the higher platform you could see going down the steps earlier, and take a left turn to enter a small alcove room with three fanged imps, one with a two-handed weapon. if you plan your movements and attacks, you can manage to knock one or two of them off the edge in the previous room, or line it up so they take hits from the arrow trap should you want to intentionally trigger it and dodge out of the way. the body on the floor in this alcove holds the scythe weapon, alongside a grave violet plant. head back out (avoiding triggering the trap) and turn left to head down a narrow corridor. this has two fanged imps lurking on the ceiling and the wall, so be careful not to head in too quickly and get surrounded. at the end, you’ll find some grave glovewort (2) and a corpse holding golden rune (3). backtrack out and if you can sneak past the patrolling troll, there is a corpse with a rune arc tucked in the back corner on that level. head then to the room with two levels interconnected by the flight of stairs with gaps on either side and drop down. here you’ll be facing another troll, though it can be snuck around if you land in a corner and crouch walk. it is crouching over a trina's lily plant, should you wish to collect it (requiring the killing of the troll). upon landing, head behind the wall to the north to grab the prattling pate (wonderful) , and then head down the passageway to the east. turn right, and you'll encounter a room with a pressure plate in the middle. beyond there will be another patrolling troll, and you can use the pressure plate against it to get in some free hits. turning right again, you'll note a ladder in the alcove that is worth sprinting to. climbing the ladder, turn right and you'll emerge where the lever is to unlock the locked doors near the entrance of the catacombs. once pulled, you can roll off the edge back onto the steps below, and backtrack through the catacombs to reach the unlocked doors, and the mist wall at the bottom of the stairs beyond. much like the watchdogs from stormfoot catacombs and the impaler's catacombs , this watchdog sticks to the usual attack patterns. the ability to walk up on its hind legs to close the distance very quickly remains, as well as its tendency to perform a wind-up vertical slam with its weapon, creating a shockwave. this time, the weapon is a staff. the watchdog can also breathe fire like its brethren, and has a similar radius to the impaler watchdog. the main difference between this watchdog to any other is the magical attacks. using its staff, when the watchdog floats into the air and performs the ground slam that emits a shockwave (which all other watchdogs also do), the shockwave is magically embued and deals more damage, with a slightly wider radius. the watchdog also uses its staff to summon spectral arrows that form in a horizontal sphere surrounding it, which then launch towards the player. these can be deadly but are relatively easy to avoid if you continuously dodge roll to the side as they follow you. they are slow enough to run away from if you need to gain some space first. another strategy is to use the pillars in the room to block the projectiles. due to the staff, this watchdog is also unlikely to perform the 360 spin with its weapon, so sticking to the back of the watchdog is a relatively safe zone, though locking on to the boss at this point can cause you to be unable to escape the shockwave attack in time. upon defeating the watchdog, it will drop the kaiden sellsword ashes , and the wispy light will allow travel back to the entrance of the catacombs. there is also some root resin in the back right corner of the room, so grab that before you exit. /n black knife catacombs is one of the minor dungeons found in the liurnia region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few treasure items and a miniboss foe. this page contains information on the location, walkthrough , and guide to traverse this dungeon, locate all of its treasure, and tips to defeat the enemies within. enemies boss notable loot skeletons/necromancers cemetery shade / black knife assassin rosus' axe , rune arc , assassin's cerulean dagger , black knifeprint , twinsage sorcerer ashes in northern liurnia, just northeast of the erdtree, you'll come across a path on the eastern side leading into a small canyon. upon arrival, you'll encounter lhutel the headless, a spectral headless enemy with a flaming sword will be guarding the entryway. riding circles around them with torrent makes the fight relatively easy. buried in the cliff face, you'll note the double doors to open leading down to a site of grace. heading down the steps to the left of the site of grace, you'll encounter a skeleton. as a rule of thumb, with these skeletons you will want to strike them once they go down (as the blue light appears on their corpse), or else they will resurrect and require defeating again. at the bottom of the stairs, you'll encounter the locked doors and summoning pool. root resin is in the left-hand corner of the room. at the top of the stairs to the left is a grave glovewort (2) plant, and at the bottom is a grave violet plant. as you approach the bottom, two more skeletons will awaken, but you'll notice that trying to perform the strike whilst they're defeated won't work. that's due to the necromancer enemy with the staff who will come from further down the corridor. only by defeating him can you ensure the skeletons stop resurrecting. to the left you'll spot a imp seal, which if unlocked is revealed to house two skeletons, a swordsman in the center of the room, and an archer in the immediate left-hand corner. after those are dealt with, loot the corpse on the right to obtain the rosus' axe weapon. heading back to the hallway, follow the path left and you'll find a grave glovewort (2) plant on the left. on the right there will be a number of dropping blades, requiring well-timed movements to avoid. there are also two skeleton archers beyond the blades to complicate matters. these archers also continually resurrect regardless, so once they're down sprint down the stairs and prepare to be ambushed by a skeleton on the right. next to the coffin you'll find a grave glovewort (3) . to the left of the room, you'll note a ladder descending. head down and you'll emerge in a large sewer room filled with small crabs. there are a number of grave violet and grave glovewort plants dotted around. as you head to the right where you'll spot a corpse, a giant crab will emerge from the ground. if you start swinging as it emerges, it should be low enough health where it can only pull off one or two attacks before you down it. the corpse holds a rune arc . be careful though, as a second giant crab will have also emerged from the area you entered from. heading back up to the room with the blades and undying archers, wait for a blade in the center of the room to drop, then stand over where it fell for it to raise you up, enabling you to roll off onto the higher platform. there you'll want to kill the necromancer to defeat the archers below as well as the skeleton guarding the necromancer. continuing down the pathway, run past the two skeleton archers and turn right to face another necromancer. kill them and all three skeletons in the room will die immediately. continue and you'll enter a room with a skeleton warrior on the right and an archer on the left. defeat those and then strike the back middle wall to reveal a hidden path to a mist wall. the black knife assassin is a full-health, far more aggressive variant of the one you can encounter in the deathtouched catacombs in limgrave. it is a good idea to use the gold summon sign outside the mist wall to bring d, hunter of the dead in to fight alongside you, and using any spirit ashes will help to draw aggro off of you for a short while. like the other black knife assassin, it performs a 360-degree spin with its blade buried in the floor, ending in a slash outwards. this attack, like all others in this fight, are highly aggressive and much faster than you will have experienced from its doppelganger. if you get caught by this spin, the slash at the end can send you flying backwards through the air, and with its speed, the assassin can very easily get a follow-up attack in. as such, keep your distance as they wind up for most of their attacks, and be methodical when you time your strikes. this speed is especially true with the assassin's spectral dodge into a lunge attack with its knife. if hit, this can very easily temporarily stagger you. this assassin also has a couple of unique moves, one of which being a spinning launch into the air with a lock-on slam attack that deals heavy damage. it's dodgeable but requires pinpoint timing just before the assassin comes back down to the ground. the other unique attack to be particularly wary of is a grab attack that is telegraphed by it swinging its left arm behind it then lunging forward. if it connects to you, the assassin will then plunge its knife into your chest and can very easily kill you, so it's in your best interest to ensure your health is 100% full just to cover for this possibility. by defeating him, you'll earn the assassin's cerulean dagger and the black knifeprint . as you exit the room after the fight, look to the left in the middle of the room (where the skeleton archer was) and you'll notice an opening. drop down and you'll re-enter the sewer area but on the other side of the metal fence. a skeleton warrior will be there in the corner to defeat, as well as two levers to pull. one will open the locked doors at the beginning of the catacombs, and the other opens the door of the metal gate, acting as a shortcut back. by pulling the lever to open the metal gate another skeleton warrior will emerge next to you, so be ready to fight. backtrack to the entry area of the catacombs and the previously locked doors will be open, leading to another mist wall. a haunting black shade with devastating blade attacks and an immobilizing spit, the cemetery shade is a fragile yet highly dangerous opponent. alongside the shade are three skeletons; two warriors and one archer. due to the small nature of the arena and sheer speed of the shade, it's recommended to use ashes like the lone wolves to draw some aggro off of you (and potentially stagger some enemies) as you prioritize dealing with the skeletons. the shade has a slashing combo with its blades that occur in two staggered bursts before an overhead strike. dodging is your best bet as the speed of the slashes makes it almost impossible to parry. the main attack to look out for is telegraphed by the shade summoning a green oozing sphere above its head, which will quickly fire in your direction and, if it hits, will completely immobilize you as the shade approaches and begins feasting on your face. this can very easily be an insta-kill scenario, so if you can dodge-roll the projectile or better yet, keep a pillar between you and the shade as it performs this move. the shade doesn't have a massive health pool, so timing your strikes well and being aggressive is the best strategy. once defeated, the shade will drop the twinsage sorcerer ashes . in the chest, you'll find some deathroot , alongside some root resin in the back left corner. /n road's end catacombs is one of the minor dungeons found in the liurnia region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few treasure items and a miniboss foe. this page contains information on the location, walkthrough, and guide to traverse this dungeon, locate all of its treasure, and tips to defeat the enemies within. enemies boss notable loot fanged imps spirit-caller snail watchdog's staff , rune arc , raya lucaria soldier ashes , glintstone sorcerer ashes in western liurnia, just to the south of the minor erdtree, you'll note a path winding down the western side of the cliff face. you'll need to loop around from the eastern side of the erdtree cliff, curve around when you reach the north end (being just above the erdtree on your map), then follow the path back down south. you'll face off against a jellyfish and some bats on approach, hanging from the rocky overhangs. past them, you'll come to a dead-end with the double doors to the catacombs on the left-hand side buried in the cliff face. after heading down past the site of grace, turn the corner and an ambushing fanged imp with a two-handed sword will try to ambush you. grab the grave violet plant in the corner before proceeding. deal with it and turning left you'll spot a lever in the distance. be careful, as you enter out into this first room another fanged imp will attack you from the right, so be prepared. as you descend the stairs in this room, grab the 3 grave glovewort plants amongst the foliage, two of which are (2) and one which is (3). before heading down the next set of stairs however, turn back to face the walls on the right of the stairs you've just descended, and there are two separate illusory walls. strike them to reveal a hidden room with a fanged imp patrolling. in the western corner of the room is a ghost glovewort (2), and in the eastern corner you'll find a corpse containing a rune arc. proceed in this hidden section to the tunnel leading down, and you'll come across a corpse in a small room holding root resin . again this room holds an illusory wall, so strike the back wall (to the east) to reveal another level down. following the steps down you'll find grave glovewort (2) and another illusory wall. strike the back wall (to the north) to reveal a room filled with coffins, and behind it an unlocked set of double doors. there is some root resin in this room, and beyond the doors, down the steps, is the mist wall. for the time being, backtrack the initial main room and head down the next flight of stairs, defeating the fanged imp lurking there. then do the same procedure, turn to face the walls to the right of this flight of stairs (with the hanging ivy) and strike it to reveal another hidden segment. in this segment is two fanged imps, so be ready to parry/dodge as soon as you reveal the compartment. once beaten, you can find a grave glovewort (3) , and a human bone shard x5 and the watchdog's staff weapon on the two corpses in the back left corner. head back out and progress through the tunnel in front of you, being wary of the fanged imp that will drop down from the ceiling in the alcove to the left, and ensuring you don't trigger the pressure plate in the center of the corridor unintentionally. in the alcove, you'll find grave glovewort (2) . continuing on, you'll enter a rectangular room with a grave glovewort (2) and a grave glovewort (3) plant in it, as well as an alcove on the opposite side of the room when you can strike the back wall (to the east) to reveal another hidden room. there you'll find a grave violet and 3 fanged imps, one guarding the chest at the end of the room, and two flanking either side of the entrance. as such, it's a good idea to bait the one across the room and draw them back out into the corridor, deal with them, then carefully go round the corner and attack one, repeating the same procedure and making it unlikely to aggro the other. once dealt with, the chest in the room contains the raya lucaria soldier ashes . from here, backtrack again to the mist wall and pass through to face the boss. a deceptive boss fight, you'll notice two things as you begin to attack the spectral warrior in front of you: one, you're dealing no damage to the true health bar, and two, this opponent is not a snail as the name implies. this is because much like the witch of hemswick from bloodborne, this warrior is a facade for the true boss. the warrior itself does have a health bar, but only once depleted with the snail reveal itself, often tucked in the back corners of the arena - upon the reveal, you can then charge at the snail and deal high amounts of damage, before it disappears again and the cycle repeats. the snail itself poses no threat, but the warrior it summons can be surprisingly deadly. the warrior will use a three-move combo of a jab, sweep and then slam using its staff, all of which can be dodge-rolled out of. the warrior is prone to also performing a long-distance stab with the tip of its staff that can very easily catch you off guard if you try to get a couple seconds of breathing room to heal or cast a spell/summon spirits, so be careful. this stab can be repeated twice in a row and followed up with an overhead slam, that thankfully doesn't produce a shockwave. if you get caught with the first stab, your i-frames will save you long enough to escape the remainder of the attack animation. the warrior can also foot stomp and emit a shockwave of holy energy, dealing substantial damage, so get a couple hits in and then pull back just in case, as the stomp can be dodge-rolled through but requires expert timing due to the speed at which the warrior executes its attacks. the main attack to be aware of however is when the warrior sprouts wings and takes into the air, with the tip of its staff spinning rapidly and becoming alight with fire. this signals that it is about to slam down in your direction very rapidly. the slam doesn't have a shockwave but if you get hit, and you're not at full hp, it can very easily one-hit you. you'll want to dodge-roll at the last possible second before the warrior connects with the ground to avoid taking any damage. it's also a worthwhile idea to use spirit ashes in this fight, something aggressive and in good numbers ie. lone wolf ashes or fanged imp ashes to help distract the warrior, even briefly, as it can provide you the space to somewhat safely cast a spell or heal where necessary. the spirits will likely be defeated relatively quickly, but every little helps to expedite this phase of the fight. once the warrior's health depletes, sprint to the back corners of the arena and swipe away as soon as the snail reveals itself. it is very vulnerable to attack, so can feasibly be killed without resummoning the warrior. once defeated, the snail will drop the glintstone sorcerer ashes . /n lakeside crystal cave is one of the minor dungeons found in the liurnia region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few treasure items and a miniboss foe. this page contains information on the location, walkthrough, and guide to traverse this

amber medallion , rune arc , latenna the albinauric in southern liurnia, just to the west of the laskyar ruins, and on the waters edge as it meets the cliff face, you'll come across a cave opening that is very easy to miss. though not covered by foliage, there is no brazier outside to provide an illuminating source to beckon you. once found, head inside and through the winding tunnel until you happen upon a site of grace overlooking a wide-open cavern. after descending through the tunnel and activating the site of grace, loot the chest to your right to gain an arteria leaf . passing down the pathway on the left, you'll encounter two demi-humans, one of which will leap from the bush. take the slope up on your immediate left to defeat another demi-human crouching by some cave moss . back down the slope, look up to the left and find a brazier higher than the other two. platform up the rocks and three demi-humans will attack; one normal, one with daggers and one with a club. loot the corpse on the floor up there to obtain hefty beast bone x5. heading down towards the other two braziers, you'll face two demi-humans, one being a human-sized variant. you can either head to the east and drop down to lower platforms in the cavern, or pass through the small tunnel to the west. in the tunnel to the west, you'll find some more cave moss on the left by the brazier, and then continue right down the tunnel to emerge in a cave that houses another demi-human and a demi-human chief. there are three budding cave moss plants dotted on the floor in this cave, as well as 5 silver firefly by the water's edge. the chest on the far side of the cave holds the spear talisman . backtrack out to the main cavern and carefully drop from platform to platform, collecting the cave moss on one platform, and then a crystal cave moss plant at the bottom alongside even more cave moss . on the eastern side of this bottom platform, look down and you'll spot another platform with a brazier. drop down and then head through the tunnel filled with crystals behind you. in this cave, you'll encounter three crystallized snails, who fire high-impact crystals in either projectile or carpet bomb fashion. the corpse on the floor in the room holds throwing daggers x5. take the tunnel to the north and grab the multiple crystal cave moss on the floor as you progress. to your left, you'll see multiple small crystal piles. these are in fact all snails, so start attacking asap to prevent their projectiles from overwhelming you once they emerge. the corpse they were guarding holds a golden rune (5). at the end of the tunnel, you'll spot a massive drop below you into a huge cavern with giant crystals. drop off the left-hand side to land near a corpse holding soft cotton x2. drop down further to loot the three corpses; one holding smithing stone (4) , one with smithing stone (2) , and the third holding a lump of flesh . heading west you'll encounter three more crystallized snails, and beyond them you'll enter a cave (without a mist wall) where the boss fight will begin. a humanoid enemy that operates on all fours, the bloodhound knight operates incredibly swiftly, using a teleport ability to instantly close distance, as well as a reliance on slashes and lunges with its sword and/or bladed gauntlet. the primary combo that the knight will perform is a three-move attack, consisting of a blade swing right to left, then left to right ending in a spin into an overhead slam with its sword. note that should the knight teleport, as soon as it emerges it will more often than not initiate into this combo immediately, so be on guard ready to parry or dodge. to help take the heat off of you for the majority of this fight, it is recommended to summon an ash spirit that consists of multiple members, the more aggressive the better. good examples would be lone wolf ashes , raya lucaria soldier ashes, or the demi-human ashes . if you have a weapon with at least +6, you should find your damage output to be sufficient enough to down the knight within a minute or so, but be sure to not get greedy with your attacks, as the knight can very easily launch into one of its faster swipes whilst you're stuck in an animation. upon defeating the knight, you'll earn the cerulean amber medallion. progress down the tunnel on the opposite side of the cave from which you entered to exit outside with the slumbering wolf's shack site of grace to the left, as well as an npc and her wolf, who reveals herself as latenna the albinauric . this is best tackled after finding albus the albinauric in the village of the albinaurics in southern liurnia. by doing so, albus will give you the haligtree secret medallion (right) , which if shown to latenna, she will request to join you to complete her journey in exchange for information about where the other half of the medallion resides. agreeing, latenna will evaporate and become an ash in your inventory - latenna the albinauric . there are also wooden platforms on the right of the shack that a corpse rests on. this corpse holds a rune arc . /n academy crystal cave is one of the minor dungeons found in the liurnia region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few treasure items and a miniboss foe. this page contains information on the location, walkthrough, and guide to traverse this dungeon, locate all of its treasure, and tips to defeat the enemies within. enemies boss notable loot demi-humans/crystallized snails crystalians crystal staff , crystal release spell , terra magicus spell , rune arc , stonesword key in north liurnia, just to the north of the temple quarter site of grace, as you're passing the left side of raya lucaria from the water, you'll spot an imp seal built into the cliff face. it is surrounded by the fp regenerating beetles, so keep an eye out to ensure you're in the right spot. after using a stonesword key to unlock the seal, head into the cave and turn right to reach a site of grace. moving past the site of grace, you'll find some budding cave moss and a summoning pool. head down the slope to the right and grab the crystal cave moss on the left-hand side before dealing with the rat lurking in the back corner. continue on and face another two rats and some crystal cave moss to grab on the left. there are multiple crystal cave moss plants lining the tunnel as you head further into the cave, and you'll eventually turn a corner into a larger cavern with 5 glintstone sorcerers. 3 you'll spot immediately as you enter the room, on the back left-hand side, and the other 2 are hidden amongst the crystals on the right. it's a good idea to use the crystals as cover to avoid getting hit by their near-constant spellcasting. in the south-eastern corner of the room, there is a little alcove with some crystal cave moss and a corpse holding cuckoo glintstone x5 . at the other end of the cavern you'll find a twinsage sorcerer to defeat, as well as 4 silver firefly on the right. continue through the tunnel ahead to enter a smaller cave with multiple budding cave moss plants dotted on the floor. there is also a corpse in a cage that contains a stonesword key . as you backtrack out, you'll spot a concealed passageway on the left, illuminated by a hanging lantern. proceed down the pathway and through the tunnel beyond to come upon a wooden door on the left. passing through it, you'll enter a new section of cave with a glintstone sorcerer and a larger, more aggressive sorcerer defending a passageway on the left. defeat them both and grab the budding cave moss near the entrance before proceeding through where the larger sorcerer was defending. you'll note a chest, though be warned, there is a glintstone sorcerer on the level above the chest that will bombard you with spells as soon as you walk out. it is possible to open the chest and grab the rune arc inside whilst only getting hit once or twice, so choose at your discretion. you can, however, backtrack out into the previous room, and strike the rock near the first budding cave moss plant closest to the door to dissipate an illusory wall. you can then head up the slope and deal with that glintstone sorcerer, and beyond is a chest at the top that contains the crystal staff . back in the main room, you'll notice to the east there is a mist wall. depending on your build, this fight can be a perplexing one. most slash/pierce weapons will prove nigh-on useless in this fight, as without two-handing the weapon you will deal minimal damage and each attack will bounce off the enemy. as such, you will want to equip a blunt weapon, focusing on strike attacks . one crystalian has a spear, the other a spellcasting staff. both are dangerous, but arguably the spellcaster can prove fatal more often. to prepare before entering the fight, equip a spirit ash that can spell cast ie glintstone sorcerer ashes or twinsage sorcerer ashes. spellcasting can deal good damage to the crystalians, so these sorcerers (alongside yourself if you have a magic build) can easily draw aggro from one crystallian while you focus on the other. the most effective strategy is to focus on the spear crystalian first. it will jab repeatedly at you, moving across the room in your direction, and can perform sweeps and a jumping slam with the spear. whilst they deal a lot of damage, they are slowly executed animations so shouldn't prove too difficult to dodge if you stay vigilant. after it has performed one of these attack animations, it should be similarly easy for you to get behind it and perform a backstab critical strike. this is repeatable and can defeat the crystalian very quickly if you efficiently execute this method. when it comes to the spellcasting crystalian, you can again loop around the back of it and critical strike it. most of its attacks are negligible if you are up close and personal, but do your best to stay away from the front of the enemy. the most devastating attack it has is telegraphed very heavily but can one-shot you if you're not careful. it is particularly difficult if you aren't able to divert its attention whilst dealing with the spear crystalian. the attack in question is signaled when the crystalian pulls back its staff to one side as it begins glowing and building with blue energy, before firing out a continuous stream of crystal shards. the closer you are, the harder these are to avoid, and generally, if you get caught in it you'll wind up dead as your i-frames won't cover you for the duration the animation lasts. you can use the stone pillars in the room to block some of these crystal shards, but this can prove difficult if the spear crystalian still stands, hence the recommendation to defeat it as quickly as possible. upon defeating both crystalians, you will earn the crystal release spell, and you can choose to use the wispy light to return to the entrance of the cave, or you can pass through the archway to ride a lift up to the academy of raya lucaria. head outside and loop around up the stairs to reach a clearing with a chest. inside the chest is the terra magicus spell. /n raya lucaria crystal tunnel is one of the minor dungeons found in the liurnia region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few treasure items and a miniboss foe. this page contains information on the location, walkthrough , and guide to traverse this dungeon, locate all of its treasure, and tips to defeat the enemies within. enemies boss notable loot crystal miners crystalian crystal knife , shatter earth spell , smithing stone miner's bell bearing north of the church of vows in eastern liurnia , along the right side of the alcove with the wandering mausoleum, head through the trees and the brush to find a cave entrance. passing down the tunnel, you'll arrive at a lift. ride it down and progress forward to find a site of grace. moving on from the site of grace, you'll come across a room with a patrolling crystal miner, which will require either a blunt weapon or two-handed attacks to ensure your weapon doesn't bounce off with each strike and deal decreased damage. critical strikes from behind are also an effective strategy, as their slow movement makes it easy to get around the back of them. up the steps to the right, you'll find another crystal miner resting next to a chest that contains somber smithing stone (2). heading northeast down the path, grab the cracked crystal deposits on the walls, and you'll emerge into an enormous cavern illuminated with blue crystals. the small platform to the left has a crystal miner and a couple of cracked crystal deposits, and to the right, you'll find three crystal miners; one patrolling and two mining. take them out and grab the smithing stone crystals that they were mining on the floor. beyond them is a lever for a lift to the left, and a tunnel to follow to the right. as the lift isn't yet operable, go through the tunnel and face a crystal miner on the right-hand side. any that are mining and have their backs to you are easy to sneak up on and critical strike, so take advantage where you can. down the first flight of stairs are two crystal miners sat down, but be careful, as you fight them you'll likely aggro the sorcerer in the alcove to the right. this sorcerer will fire dozens of glintstone crystals that can repeatedly hit you without reprieve, so keep your eye in that direction. heading into that alcove on the right, you'll find a smithing stone (3) on the left and a corpse with another smithing stone (3) on the right. backtracking, pass underneath the wooden stairs and platforms you've descended from, and you'll face a crystal miner sorcerer and a regular crystal miner. along the back wall, you'll find smithing stone (3) and multiple cracked crystal deposits. there is also a corpse on the right that holds a golden rune (3) . proceeding down the tunnel to the left, you'll arrive at another lift. descend the lift and head through into a large cavern with a chasm in the middle. there is a platform halfway down the lift you can roll off onto to obtain a somber smithing stone should you wish! defeating the crystal miner on the left, cross the wooden beam to reach the other side of the chasm and defeat the two sorcerers on the other side. it is recommended to sneak across and try to avoid the sorcerers detecting you until you are safely across, as their glintstone spells can knock you off if you aren't careful. collect the various smithing stone crystals and cracked crystal deposits, and note a lift on the left-hand side, or a tunnel to the west. ride the lift up, and then back down again to activate it as a shortcut option in case of the need for future runs/re-runs of this area. going through the tunnel, you'll be presented with two paths. from the path to the right, a marionette fighter will emerge. in that alcove, there will be a corpse holding a smithing stone , as well as a smithing stone deposit in the back right corner. now taking the left path, two marionette fighters will drop from the ceiling, one with rapid-firing bows so prioritize that one. you can then spot two marionette fighters in a room to the right, guarding a chest. though you can sneak up to one and critical strike it, the other will aggro and two additional fighters, both with bows, will appear - one will be behind you so ensure you don't get overwhelmed or surrounded. inside the chest you'll find the crystal knife . continue south and you'll enter a room with multiple crystal miners mining a cluster of smithing stones to your lower left. there will be a sitting crystal miner down the first flight of stairs, as well as two sorcerers on the floor below. the good news is that you can attack and defeat the sorcerers without making the crystal miners that are mining hostile. if you loot the multiple smithing stone deposits they are mining however, they will aggro. this is recommended though as you can get a good number of smithing stones or various qualities here. looping underneath the platform you've just descended from, you can loot the cracked crystal deposits on the wall, as well as the smithing stone crystals in the collapsed tunnel section to the west, though you will have to deal with two additional crystal miners who are mining in the area. you can now either head east through a small tunnel or north through a wider tunnel. going through the wider tunnel (pictured to the left), you'll find the shatter earth spell on a corpse tucked to the right. now heading through the smaller tunnel to the east, you'll reach yet another lift. riding it down you'll meet a mist wall, though there is a platform to the northwest halfway down that you can roll off onto that has a somber smithing stone at the end of a small tunnel. grabbing the somber smithing stone on the path to the mist wall, you're ready to face the boss. this elden ring boss is similar in strategy to its brethren that can be encountered in the academy crystal cave , yet where those two variants held a staff and a spear, this crystalian wields spinning disc weapons. the boss will often initiate the fight by throwing two discs, one at a time, that lock-on to your position. these can be tricky to dodge your first time, as you'll need to roll later than you think to prevent them from hitting you. the crystalian can also extend its arms out to the side and begin spinning furiously, acting as a spinning top darting around the arena. so long as you keep your distance, it's uncommon for this move to target you so directly that it will definitely hit you. a few dodge-rolls or seconds of sprinting in the opposite direction to the boss will give you the space that you need. another combo attack is a three-move combo, where the crystalian will swipe its larger disc slowly from side to side, then winding up to launch the disc along the floor in your direction. the swipes are slow enough that you can gain space before they make contact, and if you dodge-roll diagonally towards the crystalian as it winds up for the disc roll you can guarantee you won't get hit, as the disc spins wildly enough trying to stay locked on to you that you can easily get behind the boss and perform a critical strike. critical strikes will be your best friend here, as they deal the most efficient and guaranteed damage, but as aforementioned, the crystalian moves slowly enough (both in general traversal and with its attacks, bar the spin) that it is a reliably repeatable method to down this enemy easily. summoning any spirit ash can be useful too, as they can draw the lock-on effect of the crystalian's discs off of you during the beginning of the fight. jumping heavy attacks can also stagger the crystalian after just two strikes, opening you up to a frontal critical strike, expediting the fight even further. once defeated, the crystalian drops a smithing-stone miner's bell bearing . /n caria manor is one of the minor dungeons found in the liurnia region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few treasure items and a miniboss foe. this page contains information on the location, walkthrough, and guide to traverse this dungeon, locate all of its treasure, and tips to defeat the enemies within. enemies boss notable loot spider hands/raya lucaria spirits/wolves royal knight loretta loretta's greatbow , loretta's slash ash of war , sword of night and flame , carian grandeur ash of war , troll knight's sword , hoarfrost stomp ash of war , urumi head to the extreme north in liurnia, keeping to the western side of the lake, you'll spot a large castle elevated up on a hill. there is a long slope leading up to it, and as you approach you'll see strafing runs of magical crystals being fired in your direction almost constantly. the only way to feasibly avoid these is by riding torrent. it can also be useful to ride along the western cliff-face and use some of the geography to block some of the attacks. once you get close enough to its walls, the attacks will subside and you can head up the steps to activate the site of grace. heading into the courtyard past the site of grace, you'll begin encountering hand enemies; crawling hands, both large and small that leap at you. the large hands can also fire purple projectiles, which linger near you and then explode. many of these enemies will drop somber smithing stone of various sizes, and off amongst the grass on both sides of the courtyard you'll find various corpses with rimed crystal bud . be careful though, not only with hands drop down from the architecture above, there are dozens of hands submerged in the ground that will grab you should you step over them. as such, if you're intent on grabbing everything from the brush, look out for fingers slightly jutting out of the ground and avoid them, crouch-walking where possible. follow the path, and as a general rule of thumb, keep your eyes up high as hands, both large and small, will drop down from the structures above and ambush you. after passing underneath an arch after the path curves up and to the left, you'll arrive at an entryway to a building guarded by a large hand, as well as a small hand patrolling and another on the left wall of the steps. deal with them, then head inside (speaking to the spirit if you're so inclined) and progress up the steps to another site of grace. heading outside, proceed across the narrow pathways to confront multiple blue raya lucaria spirits. at range, they can draw their crossbows or throw magical grenades that spawn three shards that hone in on your position. defeating them, you'll be presented with two pathways. take the path to the left, and looping around the tower at the end of the path you'll find a corpse hanging over the ledge that contains a rune arc . as you begin to head back across the walkway, you'll notice to your right is a lower rampart of the manor that you can jump/drop onto the roof of. drop again from that lower roof to reach a descending ladder. once down the ladder, there will be a chest in the room containing the sword of night and flame weapon, as well as an unlockable door that leads out into the initial courtyard of the manor. once back up onto the ramparts, take the right pathway (heading straight southeast) and move slowly. a number of these raya lucaria spirits will spawn towards the end of the bridge, and some will emerge behind you so take caution and deal with those behind you first to prevent getting surrounded and overwhelmed. turning left and facing the steps heading up northeast, you'll note again on the right-hand side of the walkway there is another section of the manor you can drop down to. doing so successfully will often require a running jump, so plan accordingly. once down there, grab the rimed crystal bud from the corpse on the wooden platform, then choose a direction, left or right. underneath the steps on the left, you'll find a corpse with a golden rune (3) . to the right, you'll face four small hands defending a corpse up the steps that holds the urumi whip. at the end of the path is a pendulum statue (which is best dealt with at range if possible, and avoid its spinning saw attack at all costs), beyond which is a small platform to drop off and grab the somber smithing stone from the corpse hanging off the ledge on the right. making your way back to the stairs just past where you jumped off (either by retreading the whole manor thus far or teleporting), ride the lift up and activate the next site of grace. progressing forward, you'll emerge in a garden area where you'll find a summoning pool down the first flight of stairs, and will spot a large wolf patrolling to your right, and a golden seed tree to your left, with another large wolf gazing out into the distance. grab the golden seed, and then sneak up to the wolf and after a couple of attacks, you can knock it off the edge. turn around and defeat the other wolf, then instead of heading up the steps, curve around the right-hand side to face another wolf guarding a corpse holding some rimed crystal bud . continue left into the overgrowth and you'll find some herba plants, rowa fruit, and a miquella's lily plant. heading back around and up the steps, you'll see multiple glintstone sorcerers and a large ... . whilst you can face them head-on, if you look left of the archway you'll spot a ladder you can jump across to and climb up. at the top, you'll face a noble sorcerer, and then find a corpse to the far-right hanging over the edge containing some magic grease . head up the wooden stairs and deal with the wandering noble amongst the brush, before carefully jumping the gap to sneak around the left side of the giant. ensuring you sneak past, you can begin heading up the steps to face some ... whilst looting the corpse on the stairs for more rimed crystal bud. at the top of the stairs, enter the central section to loot a corpse with a golden rune (4); to the right is a crystal bud plant, and to the left is a secret passageway. straight ahead is a boss encounter in a large open area surrounded by chairs. it's actually recommended to face the boss first, as the secret passageway to the left requires dropping down multiple levels and therefore will take a long time to return to this spot. royal knight loretta is a spectral knight atop a spectral horse. unfortunately for you, despite the size of the arena, you're unable to mount torrent and match her. loretta performs attacks of a similar kind to the tree sentinel , where there are running sweeps, swipes to the left and right, a rearing slam with the horse, and a lunge attack (either on the floor or from the air) that jabs the spear tip at you. using a spirit ash like lone wolf ashes to keep loretta busy can allow you to heal if necessary, or to use an ash of war that deals rapid damage, like wild strikes or sword dance. the new attacks that are worth being extra cautious around are her magical spells. a regular spell she casts are spectral swords that hover above her in a semi-circle before honing in on your position. so long as you sprint and/or dodge-roll these can be easily avoided. around the halfway point of the fight, loretta will also begin using a large spectral bow to fire a devastating arrow. this can be tricky to avoid, but if you dodge at the very last second before the projectile hits you, you can escape damage. loretta can also power up and imbue her spear attacks with magical energy. the combos that loretta performs (which is often a two-move attack of vertical 360 spear swings) can very easily kill you in one hit, as the first hit will stunlock you, and your i-frames won't save you from the second. once you defeat loretta, you'll earn the loretta's greatbow spell and the ash of war: loretta's slash . with that, you can head to the northwestern corner of the arena to proceed towards the three sisters. you can also backtrack to the secret passageway to your right as you exit the arena from where you entered, and can drop down. you'll eventually encounter living jar enemies, which upon defeating (best with a blunt weapon that will deal higher damage and stagger with power attacks) will drop raw meat dumpling and living jar shard . keep dropping down and soon, to the right, you'll be able to drop onto the ramparts of the manor. on the lowered section of the rampart you'll find a corpse on the left hanging off the ledge that holds the ash of war: carian grandeur . drop back down into the very first courtyard you explored, then head to the southeastern corner of the manor on your map to find some steps leading to a small room. inside is a hunched over sorcerer (whos shard rain attack is the only real threat that needs avoiding), and a corpse holding the glintstone craftsman's cookbook (6) . /n ruin-strewn precipice is one of the minor dungeons found in the liurnia region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few treasure items and a miniboss foe. this page contains information on the location, walkthrough, and guide to traverse this dungeon, locate all of its treasure, and tips to defeat the enemies within. enemies boss notable loot land octopuses/bats/chanting winged dames magma wyrm makar serpent-god's curved sword , dragon heart , magma wyrm's scalesword in northern liurnia, heading up through the deep and narrow ravine heading northeast, you'll reach the ravine-veiled village site of grace. you'll note a series of ladders heading up the cliff, which will lead you through a tunnel filled with stonediggers and vulgar militia. as you make your way through, you'll reach a lift, which one ridden up will lead to another cave of stonediggers. proceed up the slope to the northwest and you'll arrive at the ruin-strewn precipice site of grace. past the site of grace, ride the lift up, and grab the cracked crystal from the deposit on the wall. head along the platform to the left, dealing with the vulgar militant and bat that wait on the corner. heading up the stairs you'll face another 3 bats feasting on a corpse. you can also backtrack and drop off the stairs to land on a lower platform which curves around to a stonedigger and a cracked crystal deposit, and a ladder to get back up afterward. continuing up the longer ladder beyond, you'll find two bats in the northeast corner over a corpse, as well as a chanting winged dame in the western corner near the next ladder. upon approaching the chanting winged dame, it will shriek and summon 4 additional bats to attack you. dealing with those, avoiding the poison cloud that the winged dame can emit, climb the ladder and face off against two small land octopuses as well as 2 bats that are hanging from the small overhang on the left. up the next ladder will be two small land octopuses, as well as a chanting winged dame and a winged dame sorcerer on the raised platform to the left. you can lure one of them by using ranged attacks, and that is recommended as if both winged dames attack you at once you can get very easily overwhelmed. a corpse in one of the tents holds a smithing stone (3) as well as a smithing stone (4) deposit on the wall. here you'll have two paths to choose from; one to the southwest where the harpies were, where you can ride a lift up, or you can head to the opposite end of the clearing and climb a ladder. at the top of the ladder you'll need to walk across the wooden planks to face off against 5 small land octopuses and one large one. there are two corpses in this area, one with smithing stone (3) and the other holds the serpent-god's curved sword . there is also a smithing stone (4) deposit in the southwestern corner. backtracking to the lift you'd encountered just prior, at the top of the lift you'll find the next site of grace. beyond the site of grace is a tunnel leading to a mist wall. before entering, you can use the gold summon sign on the right (if you wish) to summon great horned tragoth as a co-operator. similar to the magma wyrm fight in gael tunnel , makar focuses on spewing lava from its mouth, coating the majority of the arena in a dangerous persistent substance. the wyrm's most common moves revolve around a charge that, whilst running in a straight line, will emit lava from its mouth covering its entire path, and the lava spreads out as time passes on. the wyrm also has a tendency, if there is a bit of distance between you and it, to spit a magma ball at you which explodes in a small aoe and settles on the ground. both of these attacks, whilst highly damaging if you get caught in them, are heavily telegraphed by the wyrm rearing its head back and opening its mouth with an orange glow building there. it's difficult to discern between the two attack animations, but both require the same strategy; dodge-roll to the side as a precaution, if it's the spit you will have dodged the ball and can charge the wyrm, if its the charge, keep dodge-rolling and get up behind it to get some easy hits. like the various dragons in elden ring, the wyrm can perform a tail sweep that acts as a 180 turn for it should you spend too long behind the creature. this can similarly be dodge-rolled through if you counter-intuitively roll towards the wyrm. if you keep at its side too long, it can bend its head around and spit magma to the side. if it begins this, which will be clear to see from the way the wyrm begins to contort its head around, just head to its back end and keep hitting worry-free for a few seconds. at around 50% health, the wyrm begins utilizing the blade it carries in its right hand. it will use the blade in place of its tail sweep, achieving the exact same effect; requiring a dodge-roll through the blade swipe and ensuring the wyrm is facing you. if you are around the front of the wyrm, it can also raise the sword horizontally with both hands and slam it into the ground creating a shockwave. the animation as the wyrm stands on its hind legs to perform this slam does allow you to roll underneath its belly, and doing so will ensure you avoid damage (so long as you get out from underneath it before it comes down). makar can also stand back on its hind legs and vomit magma in a small area in front of itself, and can be avoided much like the other lava-based attacks; keep your distance and dodge-roll around to the back of the wyrm to take advantage of the long animation spewing lava entails. upon defeating magma wyrm makar, you'll earn the magma wyrm's scalesword and a dragon heart . on the opposite end of the room from where you entered, you'll find a lift that acts as an alternative path to the atlus plateau. /n elden ring features a large variety of different types of dungeons, and unlike previous from software titles, most of these dungeons are entirely optional, and serve as side

erdtree catacombs is one of the minor dungeons found in the caelid region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few treasure items and a miniboss foe. this page contains information on the location, walkthrough, and guide to traverse this dungeon, locate all of its treasure, and tips to defeat the enemies within. enemies boss notable loot fanged imps/fleshy blobs erdtree burial watchdog (scepter), erdtree burial watchdog (sword) imp head (wolf) , mad pumpkin head ashes , sacramental bud , aeonian butterfly on the border between limgrave and caelid, directly next to the minor erdtree along the north coast, is a set of double doors buried in the cliff face. to safely access this, you'll need to defeat the erdtree avatar protecting the erdtree, and then loop around the right side of the tree to find the doors. after heading inside, pass down the first set of stairs to find the site of grace. beyond the site of grace, as you approach the right turn a fanged imp will drop from the ceiling and attack you, and after clearing it you'll arrive at a lift. ride it down and you'll have two options. you can head straight forward (west) down a flight of steps, or turn around 180 degrees and head into the passage to the east. heading east, you'll find a grave glovewort (4) plant, and as you take the left turn you'll emerge into a multi-leveled room filled with scarlet rot. as you head out into the room, 5 fleshy blobs will drop from the wall behind you, so either enter the room and quickly backstep or sprint to the other side of the room to keep out of the liquid. the corpse in the center of the room holds an aeonian butterfly . fanged imps will bombard you with firebombs from the level above, so try to keep underneath the sheltered portion of the room. on the back wall of the room, you'll find a grave glovewort (5) , and in the right corner of the room by the entrance is another grave glovewort (4) . backtrack out, likely with a maxed scarlet rot meter, and you can ride the lift back up, and rest at the site of grace to remove the status effect. keep in mind that this does reset the fanged imp you'll need to deal with. now taking the other path down the steps to the west, you'll meet another fanged imp at the left turn. opening out into a square room with a column in the middle, there will be a fanged imp to both the left and right that can be lured back into the corridor to maximize the chances of hitting them both with the same strikes. there is also a grave violet plant on the left side of the corridor. on the opposite side of the central column is a grave glovewort (3) . continuing on, you'll arrive at the room with the lever. on the immediate right upon entry to this room is fanged imp wielding a two-handed blade. another fanged imp will descend from the ceiling in the center of the room. a grave violet plant is located on the right-hand side of the room, and upon pulling the lever, backtrack all the way to the lift near the site of grace at the beginning of the catacombs. when at the lift, trigger it to rise and roll back off of it, to reveal a hidden path below. drop down and defeat the fanged imp there, again with it wielding a two-handed weapon. proceeding down the steps, you'll note more scarlet rot-inducing liquid and multiple fleshy blobs that drop from the ceiling. it is a good idea to have at least 4 or 5 preserving boluses in your inventory to alleviate the build-up of scarlet rot you'll receive in this section. in the middle right alcove of this water-logged room is a small tunnel with a set of stairs leading up. head there and you'll face a number of small crabs guarding a grave glovewort (4) plant and a corpse holding a golden rune (4) . there is also a ladder to the right of the room, which upon climbing will land you in a long corridor lined with fanged imps. there is a fanged imp immediately to your left, and one on the right on the opposite side of the room. a fanged imp will also drop down on the opposite end of the long corridor as you proceed down it, grabbing the grave glovewort (3) on the left as you do so. at the end of the corridor, a corpse is draped over a coffin that holds the imp head (wolf), and to your right, you'll be able to emerge on the upper level of the initial scarlet rot room from earlier. deal with the two fanged imps on the left-hand side and grab the grave glovewort (5) plant. on the right side, a corpse hangs over the edge holding a sacramental bud . backtrack down to the tight tunnel leading down into the second scarlet rot room and turn right, sprinting to grab the grave violet off of the corpse on the left side of the passageway before running through, turning left, and arriving at the unlocked doors leading down to the mist wall. like the burial watchdogs at cliffbottom catacombs and impaler's catacombs , you will likely be familiar with their attacks by the time you encounter these. it's in fact recommended to face those first, as this is a boss fight with two bosses with different attacks and patterns. one of the watchdogs wields a sword and performs the usual swipes and stabbing lunges, and can stand on its hind legs and perform a vertical slash with its sword or a floating aoe shockwave ground slam. the watchdog wielding the scepter can perform similar horizontal swipes and a floating aoe shockwave ground slam (this time magic imbued). it does however have a special attack where it summons a number of magical projectiles that arc over it and hone in on your position. both watchdogs have the ability to spew fire from their mouths in an 18-degree semi-circle in front of themselves. as with other fights against multiple opponents, this can prove to be a difficult encounter. whilst avoiding the attacks of one watchdog you can very easily get caught out by the other one. though they are unlikely to survive, it's worth summoning any spirit ash you like; less to deal additional damage and more to attempt to draw the focus of at least one of the watchdogs off of you. the seemingly best watchdog to focus on first is the one wielding the sword, as it often gets closer to you than the other watchdog which more frequently hangs back to spell cast. using the pillars in the room can also be effective to split the watchdogs up, or to block the spellcaster's projectiles, but be wary as these pillars can be destroyed should the watchdogs attack near it. upon defeating the watchdogs, you'll earn the mad pumpkin head ashes . /n gael tunnel is one of the minor dungeons found in the caelid region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few treasure items and a miniboss foe. this page contains information on the location, walkthrough, and guide to traverse this dungeon, locate all of its treasure, and tips to defeat the enemies within. enemies boss notable loot stonediggers/godrick knights magma wyrm cross-naginata , dragon heart , moonveil a relatively unique occurence, there are actually two entrances available to this dungeon. one is barely in the northeast of limgrave, up the cliff face. the other entrance is only a small amount direct west from that entrance, but lands itself within caelid. this walkthrough will detail the dungeon via the entrance in caelid, as it provides the most traditional coverage (with the dungeon boss at the end). just south of the shack of the rotting, right on the edge of the cliff dropping off back into limgrave, you'll find a small encampment guarded by two godrick knights with spears and shields. beyond them, to the right buried in the rockface is the entrance to the tunnel. proceed inside and kill the two godrick knights at the end of the tunnel, before carefully dropping down off the left side of the platform, jumping/dropping from rock ledge to rock ledge before reaching the bottom and activating the site of grace. after descending the platforms and activating the site of grace, you'll emerge into a cavern filled with stonediggers and godrick knights. you can sneak up and backstab the knight on the right, and deal with the patrolling stonedigger down the first flight of stairs. you'll spot a corpse on the left of this platform that holds a golden rune (5) . to the right you'll find two godrick knights crouched near a tunnel; they'll be looking at a small land octopus. there's a smithing stone (4) just beyond them on the left wall, so grab that as you proceed down the tunnel. as you exit out of the tunnel, you'll be in a darkened cave with two small land octopuses. as you take them out, a large land octopus will descend from the ceiling on the left side of the cave. after clearing them out, you'll want to grab the silver firefly group resting on the right side of the cave along with a smithing stone (4) deposit, with another deposit on the back wall. on the left side of the cave is a corpse holding the cross-naginata spear, as well as a somber smithing stone (4) deposit to the left of the corpse. backtracking out to the main cavern with the stonediggers, head left underneath the platform you initially descended from, and systematically take out the stonediggers (you should be able to clear the closest few without aggroing the rest). as you approach the visible godrick knight, another in the darkness at the back will blow his horn alerting all nearby enemies. this will draw all the stonediggers in the vicinity, so keep your head on a swivel. after besting them all, destroy the barrels at the back to loot a corpse holding the gold-pickled fowl foot . you can also loot the dozen or so cracked crystal deposits lining the left-hand wall. heading west, deeper into the cave you can backstab the knight crouching over the ledge, then descend the ladder to face another godrick knight (who will likely blow a horn again) and a stonedigger mining another cracked crystal deposit. there are a couple of corpses on the ground here, one that holds grace mimic x5 , and another that holds large glintstone scrap x5 . continuing through the tunnel, you'll arrive at some wooden gates. grab the smithing stone (4) deposit on the southern wall, then open the smaller door on the left-hand side to be greeted by alexander the iron fist (should you have freed him from the ground prior). beyond alexander is another smithing stone (4) deposit on the left, and a site of grace to the right. beyond the site of grace is the alternative entrance to the tunnel via the cliffs in limgrave. backtrack to the larger wooden doors and face off against the boss of this dungeon. a boss resembling a winged salamander, the magma wyrm relies a lot on spewing magma to cover the arena in a persistent damaging lava. the wyrm's most common moves revolve around a charge that, whilst running in a straight line, will emit lava from its mouth covering its entire path, and the lava spreads out as time passes on. the wyrm also has a tendency, if there is a bit of distance between you and it, to spit a magma ball at you which explodes in a small aoe and settles on the ground. both of these attacks, whilst highly damaging if you get caught in them, are heavily telegraphed by the wyrm rearing its head back and opening its mouth with an orange glow building there. it's difficult to discern between the two attack animations, but both require the same strategy; dodge-roll to the side as a precaution, if it's the spit you will have dodged the ball and can charge the wyrm, if its the charge, keep dodge-rolling and get up behind it to get some easy hits. like the various dragons in elden ring, the wyrm can perform a tail sweep that acts as a 180 turn for it should you spend too long behind the creature. this can similarly be dodge-rolled through if you counter-intuitively roll towards the wyrm. if you keep at its side too long, it can bend its head around and spit magma to the side. if it begins this, which will be clear to see from the way the wyrm begins to contort its head around, just head to its back end and keep hitting worry-free for a few seconds. at around 50% health, the wyrm begins utilizing the blade it carries in its right hand. it will use the blade in place of its tail sweep, achieving the exact same effect; requiring a dodge-roll through the blade swipe and ensuring the wyrm is facing you. if you are around the front of the wyrm, it can also raise the sword horizontally with both hands and slam it into the ground creating a shockwave. the animation as the wyrm stands on its hind legs to perform this slam does allow you to roll underneath its belly, and doing so will ensure you avoid damage (so long as you get out from underneath it before it comes down). upon defeating the magma wyrm, you'll earn a dragon heart and the moonveil katana. /n gaol cave is one of the minor dungeons found in the caelid region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few treasure items and a miniboss foe. this page contains information on the location, walkthrough, and guide to traverse this dungeon, locate all of its treasure, and tips to defeat the enemies within. enemies boss notable loot rats/putrid corpses/vulgar militants frenzied duelist wakizashi , pillory shield , regalia of eochaid just to the southeast of the fort gael north site of grace, and a fraction northeast of fort gael itself, the entrance to this cave is down in the red liquid below the fort on the eastern side, tucked into the southwestern alcove of the cliff face. to enter this cave will require a stonesword key, so ensure you have one before travelling here. upon using the stonesword key, proceed through the tunnel and find a site of grace. after heading into the tunnel and activating the site of grace, grab the rune arc from the chest to the left, and progress forward. you'll emerge in a well-lit cave with a small rat guarding a corpse on the left that holds a golden rune (2) . continuing on, a slope will descend downwards towards a metal gate; halfway down the slope will be another small rat and an open gate tucked into the right-hand wall. head through the open gate and proceed down a long tunnel. at the end of the tunnel, it appears you've hit a dead-end but in fact, the floor will fall through and you'll land in a cell below. there are a number of other cells in the room beyond housing various flaming putrid corpses. you can actually hit a good number of them through the bars should they be kneeling wailing at the gate. this is advised as you'll soon be opening up these gates and allowing them to roam free, so the more you take out now, the less you'll have to deal with later. heading into the room on the left, there will be more cells and a vulgar militant will spring at you from the right-hand side of the room. in the northwest corner, you'll spot a wooden door built into a stone structure, with a lever resting on the platform above the door. proceed through the tunnel to the left of the door and drop down to face off against two vulgar militants, with a locked cell to the right and a passageway to the left. continue onwards passing a vast number of cells lining the tunnel walls before emerging out into a larger cave. to the left, you'll see two locked cells, and to the right in the northern corner of the room will be a tunnel sloping up. arriving at the top of the sloped tunnel, you'll see a small rat run off to the left to join a giant rat on the left that's guarding two corpses. as you deal with the two of them, a further two small rats will come down from the slope to the east. the corpses hold a golden rune (4) and turtle neck meat . heading up the slope to the east, you'll eventually arrive in a structured two-tier room with three vulgar militants inside. a corpse in the northeast corner holds a golden rune (5) , there is a chest in one of the cells ahead that holds a somber smithing stone (5), and the small steps down in the southeast corner allow you to open the previously locked wooden door you spotted earlier. head up the stone steps in the room to pull the lever and open all the previously locked cells. dropping down off the lever platform, in the southeast corner, the open gate leads up a slope that will lead you out through the very first locked gate you encountered upon entering the cave (a good shortcut for returning in the future). you'll want to turn left however after dropping down from the lever and in the north corner of the room, the cell contains two corpses, one with old fang x5 and one with a pillory shield . if you head out the northeast exit of the room and turn left, the cell has a corpse holding a golden rune (2) . backtrack and head through the opening on the opposite side of the room (next to the wooden door, where you have to drop down) and the cell to the right has a corpse with another golden rune (2) . follow the path (back down the sloped tunnel lined with cells) and the smaller cell halfway down on the left has three corpses, one with the wakizashi weapon, one with a stonesword key , and one with a golden rune (4) . at the end of the tunnel, turn left, facing south, and within the deeper cell, you'll be able to spot two corpses. one holds a rainbow stone and the other a golden rune (4) . on the right side of this cell, you'll see some wooden planks against the wall. destroy them to reveal a hole, on the opposite side of which is a series of platforms to drop down onto, and after hitting the ground at the bottom you'll be immediately initiated into a boss fight. the frenzied duelist is a humanoid enemy similar to the grave warden duelist of murkwater catacombs , but unlike that enemies dual hammers, the frenzied duelist wields a large two-handed axe and a ball and chain. the duelist often relies on a three-move combo, consisting of a 180-degree swing with the axe, then spinning into a 360-degree swing, ending with a foot stomp with a long wind-up animation. the axe swings can be dodged or parried, and the foot stomp is telegraphed enough to avoid, and though it has a slight lock on, the reach doesn't extend too far if you begin gaining distance. the duelist can also spin twice with diagonal axe swings; the first swing has a long wind-up and therefore can lead you to dodge too early and get caught out, and the second swing ends with the axe slamming into the ground with slightly further reach than the first swing, and can send you flying if you get hit. the duelist also swings the ball and chain around its head in a wide aoe sweep; it has a couple of wind-up swings before the final swipe, which is the one that you're gonna want to dodge through. when the duelist pulls its right arm back, it is about to initiate a grab attack. if it connects, they will lift you into the air, hold you there for a few seconds then throw you across the arena. unlike other grab attacks in the game, whilst this attack does still deal decent damage, it often won't be a death-dealing blow to you. you can dodge back or to the right to avoid it, and can present an opportunity to quickly get behind it and perform a critical strike backstab. at around 50% health, the duelist can perform a battle cry that strengthens its attacks, and the attacks available to them change slightly. it can perform an overhead vertical slam with the axe, a charge where it primes the axe up and behind itself which culminates in the two 360-degree spins as it finishes the charge. another attack is a running drag along the floor, where it drags the axe and upon reaching you swipes the axe up, staggering you if it connects, and finishing in an overhead slam. these charging combos in particular can prove fatal if not countered, so be on the lookout should it begin running at you. upon defeating the frenzied duelist, you'll earn the putrid corpse ashes , and if you continue southwest down through the opening, you'll emerge in limgrave next to some tombstones, the central one of which has the regalia of eochaid weapon in front of it. /n caelid catacombs is one of the minor dungeons found in the caelid region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few treasure items and a miniboss foe. this page contains information on the location, walkthrough, and guide to traverse this dungeon, locate all of its treasure, and tips to defeat the enemies within. enemies boss notable loot miranda flowers/skeletons cemetery shade miranda sprout ashes , kindred of rot ashes in southern caelid, if you depart from the cathedral of dragon communion and loop down around the cliff to the lowest level and curve around to the northwest, you'll head down a path that dead-ends into the double doors for the catacombs. proceed inside and down the first flight of steps is a site of grace. after descending the stairs past the site of grace, you'll enter a room with a grave violet plant on the immediate left. the floor is a liquid that will inflict scarlet rot, but you can stick to either side where there is dry land. three miranda sprouts will emerge from the ground in the room as soon as you enter, so be sure to clear them quickly before they can spew more spores into the air. grab the grave glovewort (4) and root resin from the left-hand side, and as you head down the tunnel and around the corner a skeleton will try to ambush you. as with all skeletons in elden ring, remember to strike again once they are defeated to prevent them from resurrecting. there is a grave glovewort (3) plant in the far corner. as you head down the steps into the next room, grab the grave violet plant and deal with the skeleton archer to the right. down the flight of stairs to your left, a giant miranda flower will be lurking around the corner to the right. this room also has scarlet rot liquid, so be sure to have your flasks and/or preserving boluses ready in case the meter maxes out. in the sheltered section of the lower level, beneath the area you just descended from, an illusory wall is tucked in the southern corner where a miranda sprout defends two ghost glovewort plants as well as a corpse holding the miranda sprout ashes . the giant miranda flower is guarding a grave glovewort (4) plant in the corner. down the steps past the miranda flower, you'll enter a small square room with a circular column. another grave glovewort plant is in front of you, as well as a number of miranda sprouts buried in the ground that will emit spore clouds. beyond is the room with a summoning pool and the locked doors. turn around and strike the closest side of the central column in the previous room to reveal a small opening that houses the lever. pull it to open the locked doors and then proceed through them and down the stairs to the mist wall. this cemetery shade is identical in form and strategy to the one you encounter in the black knife catacombs and tombsward catacombs . it is a black spectral creature, harnessing fast-striking blades and immobilizing spit. like its brethren, the shade is extremely vulnerable to melee damage, incentivizing getting up close and personal - which is the risk-reward as the shade can teleport instantly and its flurry of blade attacks in a 3-phase combo come so quickly it's nigh-on impossible to parry or fully block. the main attack to look out for is the aforementioned spit. the shade will summon a green oozing sphere above its head and then fires it at you which, should it make contact, will completely immobilize you for a few seconds. this allows the shade to come up to you and begin gnawing at your face, dealing devastating amounts of damage. the best way to counter this is to spawn in spirits, particularly aggressive ones in groups ie. lone wolf ashes, to draw the shade's attention and allow you to deal heavy damage, often finishing the fight before the wolves can be killed. it is helpful to have a weapon with at least +6 to make light work of the shade. upon defeating the cemetery shade, you'll earn the kindred of rot ashes . /n sellia crystal tunnel is one of the minor dungeons found in the caelid region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few treasure items and a miniboss foe. this page contains information on the location, walkthrough, and guide to traverse this dungeon, locate all of its treasure, and tips to defeat the enemies within. enemies boss notable loot crystal miners/lesser kindred of rot fallingstar beast rune arc , faithful canvas talisman , gravity stone chunk , somberstone miner's bell bearing you can actually reach this dungeon very early in the game, despite being in caelid. if you open the chest in dragon-burnt ruins in lake agheel, limgrave, you'll be teleported partway into this dungeon. you can also naturally find this dungeon by heading diagonally northwest from sellia, town of sorcery. the entrance to the cave will be visible thanks to a brazier outside, and is buried in the cliff face relatively close to the westernmost walls of sellia. through a short tunnel, you'll emerge into a cave with a site of grace. to the left of the site of grace is a corpse in the corner that holds... . after climbing the ladder to the right of the room, you'll head up a slope into a large cavern with crystal miners and 2 lesser kindred of rot. there are dozens of cracked crystal deposits to gather in this room, as well as some smithing stone (5) deposits along the left-hand side of the room. in the wooden shack down to the left, a corpse holds a golden rune (5) . continuing up the slope curving around to the right, you can loop into another wooden shack (the one you teleport into should you get here via dragon-burnt ruins) and a chest is in the corner that contains... at the top of the slope, there is another crystal miner to the right and a lesser kindred of rot on the wooden platform to the left. there is a corpse on the edge of this wooden platform that holds a rune arc . you can then drop off the edge of this wooden platform and take out the crystal miner on the wooden platform one level down, then drop down on top of the first wooden shack to loot a corpse holding glintstone scrap x6 . back at the top of the slope, grab the cracked crystal and smithing stone (5) deposits where the crystal miner was, then turn around to look back down the slope. you'll note you can perform a running jump onto the higher wooden shacks roof, then across to another wooden platform on the opposite side of the room which allows you to bypass the debris blocking the path to the east. upon doing so, you can jump across the top of the debris to reach the corpse draped over the pole and receive a cuckoo glintstone . progressing up this new slope, you'll face a crystal miner. at the top, you'll open out into a room with a ladder to the right. head up it and do a 180-degree turn to cross over a wooden plank and loot a sitting corpse holding a somber smithing stone (4) . proceeding into the next room, you'll be above the initial cave room. a lesser kindred of rot will be on the roof across the room, as well as a crystal miner to the right. cross over and defeat them to head into the shack and grab the rock blaster spell from the chest inside. there are two smithing stone (5) deposits in the northeast corner of the cave. looping around the left side of the shack, you can climb the ladder at the end of the walkway to face off against two crystal miners, and grab the golden rune (4) on the corpse sitting on the ledge. be sure to kick the ladder directly in front of the corpse to allow a shortcut should you need it. in the northwest corner is a somber smithing stone (5) deposit. continue through the tunnel nearby to reach a new cave. in the alcove to the left of the corpse on the floor that you'll be able to spot from a distance is a lesser kindred of rot waiting to ambush you, so be ready for it to jump out. the aforementioned corpse holds dragonwound grease . in the alcove the kindred of rot came from is a somber smithing stone (4) deposit. up the steps to the right of the corpse are two more lesser kindred of rot, which you can sneak up to one of and get the drop on. the corpse that the kindred of rot were praying in front of holds the faithful's canvas talisman . to the left is a smithing stone (5) deposit. head down the tunnel to the west and open the wooden double doors to face a boss. a bull-type animal with mandibles and a tail, this creature is covered in crystals that act as a protective armor. because of the size of the beast and the limited size of the arena, you'll need to do some smart maneuvering and dodging to stay on top of the situation. the main attacks that the beast performs are swiping its head back and forth, and an attack where it opens up its mandibles to bite at you. a key one to avoid is the charge attack, where the beast essentially revs up and charges in a straight line across the arena three times, changing directions at the end of each of the charges. you'll need to be careful timing your rolls, as too early or too late and the beast will steer into you during the charge. the other key attack to avoid is the beast's gravitational moves, to either create a radius around itself causing things to levitate, or using the gravity to summon rock shards from the ground that can pierce you and/or send you flying into the air. both of these gravitational attacks are telegraphed as the beast conjures purple lightning around its mandibles, or the sparks appearing on the ground to signal the radius. upon defeating the fallingstar beast, you'll earn gravity stone chunk x4 , a somber smithing stone (6) , smithing stone (7) x5 , and the somberstone miner's bell bearing . /n divine tower of caelid is one of the minor dungeons found in the caelid region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few treasure items and a miniboss foe. this page contains information on the location, walkthrough, and guide to traverse this dungeon, locate all of its treasure, and tips to defeat the enemies within. enemies boss notable loot radahn soldiers/blackflame monks godskin apostle numen's rune , godskin apostle hood , godskin apostle robe , godskin apostle bracelets , godskin apostle trousers , godslayer's greatsword to the north of central caelid, on the coast to the west of dragonbarrow fork, you'll encounter a large stone tower. head up to the edge of the ridge by the tower and you'll note a number of large tree branches beneath you that attach to the tower, allowing you to jump onto them (on or off of torrent) and cross to reach the narrow ledges lining the outside of the tower. jump across the branch and deal with the soldier with the flaming pole around the side of the ladder. then head up the ladder and pass along the broken segments of the column to your left. continuing jump across the gaps as you turn the corner, and use torrent to jump the larger gap as you turn to face east, passing the ladder for now. around that back corner to the east is a corpse holding a numen's rune . backtrack and climb the ladder to reach a site of grace on the left. if you head up the stairs to the west, you can open the door at the top on the left to reach the elevator room allowing you to restore radahn's great rune , providing you have already defeated starscourge radahn . other than that, head down the various stairs to the east of the site of grace to face off against two radahn soldiers. there is a locked door to the southwest, so you'll need to do some very intricate platforming in this section. drop off onto the column below to the northwest, then perform a running jump to the platform across the gap on the right. as you land, it will collapse and you'll land with it a couple of floors below. then, staying close to the central structure this whole room revolves around, very carefully drop off the edge to land on a platform below. then carefully drop onto the unlit brazier on the right-hand side, then the platform beneath that. jump across to the next column along to the southwest, then jump across and down to the platform southeast, beneath the brazier on the outer wall. then turn around and jump back across to the central section, where you'll see a radahn soldier to the left near a pressure plate. be careful fighting this radahn soldier, as the geometry can make it very easy to be knocked off/backward, and rolling is a no-no. after defeating the soldier, step on the pressure plate to summon a lift. ride the lift up and follow the path around to the left. along the wall to the right is a ladder that will lead you up to the locked door you encountered earlier, allowing a shortcut. head back down the ladder and continue on where a blackflame monk will confront you. beyond the blackfire monk, you'll find a dead-end. to the left of the corpse at this dead-end, walk very carefully along the ledge, until you reach the far side where you'll see a fractured column beneath you. drop down onto it and take a massive fall (without fall damage), and you'll land near another pressure plate to summon a second lift. ride that lift down to reach the next site of grace. head down the steps past the site of grace to confront another blackflame monk who is guarding a mist wall. a tall slender white figure bathed in robes, the godskin apostle wields a hooked staff. it's recommended to have a weapon of at least +11 to be able to deal sufficient damage. the apostle will, at range, throw blackflame at you, knocking you to the ground should it make contact. these can be easily dodge-rolled so long as you keep an eye on the apostle at all times, otherwise this will catch you out and leave you vulnerable to a follow-up attack. as a melee fighter, the apostle is incredibly aggressive. the apostle can perform jabs with the lower end of its staff but mainly relies on fast flurries and combos. it spins staff furiously in front of itself, creating a whirlwind-type effect that is recommended that you just run away from. it will also perform multiple 360-degree spins often ending in an overhead jumping slam. all of these attacks are best dodged, as the ferocity of the attacks can make it incredibly risky to attempt a parry. at around 50% health, the apostle will float off the ground and hunch up before exploding out in a blackflame sphere. this initiates the second phase of the encounter, where the apostle becomes even more aggressive and speedy. it also has the ability to extend its body to cross the entire distance of the arena, performing variations of sweeps, slams, and slashes but aren't restricted to the apostle's immediate vicinity. the best way to make this encounter far easier, like other boss fights, is to use the mimic tear ashes. that allows the apostle to focus many of its attacks on the mimic, which makes it easier to execute jumping attacks that can stagger the apostle opening it up to critical strikes. upon defeating the godskin apostle, you'll earn the godskin apostle hood , the godskin apostle robe , the godskin apostle bracelets , and the godskin apostle trousers . if you head down the steps on the opposite side of the arena to where you entered, you'll find a wisp of light to teleport you outside the tower, alongside a chest that contains the godslayer's greatsword .

serpent bow , venomous fang , gold scarab in western caelid, head east from the smoldering wall site of grace and you'll come across a canyon. near the pendulum statue enemy, there will be a tree extending across the canyon that will allow you to traverse it and reach a ledge on the other side that leads into the cave. descending the sloping tunnel, you'll soon arrive at a site of grace. beyond the site of grace, drop down and you'll land in a pool of scarlet rot. this pool is deep and therefore your movement is significantly slowed, so it will be pivotal to keep your flasks topped up before progressing, as well as equipping some preserving boluses if you have some. it's recommended to have at least 9 flasks total here to keep topping up your health if you don't have the boluses. heading to the left you'll see a deactivated pendulum statue with a fork in the path. to the right is a corpse holding a ... as well as some aeonian butterfly flying around. down the left path is a slope that leads to a platform with more deactivated pendulum statues, and dropping down in front of another statue is a corpse that holds the serpent bow . to the right is a fungal spellcaster and heading down the slope behind it is a room with a small rat and another fungal spellcaster. continuing on, you'll enter a tunnel, around the corner of which being two small rats guarding a corpse holding fire grease . be sure to keep an eye on your health here if your scarlet rot meter is maxed, as the rats can attack and knock that extra bit of health off (if it's also depleting) that can spell doom. aeonian butterfly are dotted around the room. head up to deal with the fungal spellcasters first so their ranged attacks don't catch you off-guard, then clear out the miranda plants one by one. with the room safe (bar the circle of scarlet rot running around the outskirts), you can platform up the destroyed pendulum statues on the west side of the room to reach a ledge with a corpse that holds the venomous fang . dropping back down, head up the ledge that the fungal spellcasters were on and proceed through the tunnel beyond. as the tunnel curves round to the right, you'll be greeted with a mist wall. double the fun of the cleanrot knight available in stillwater cave, you have a knight with a sword and spear (that is from stillwater cave), and a knight wielding a sickle. upon entering the arena, you'll see the knight wielding a sword and a spear. it is recommended to have a weapon of at least +6 to expedite the fight in its opening moments before the second knight arises from the scarlet rot in the center of the room. ranged spirit ashes like the marionette soldiers ashes are excellent here as they can interrupt a lot of the spear knight's attacks and whilst they block the projectiles, you can get behind them and get a couple of free backstab critical strikes. the knight can swipe with its sword, lunge with its spear, and cross the two together in front of itself to protect against your attacks. whilst these moves can cause issues, they can be easily parried or dodged. the problem begins when the second knight rises from the scarlet rot in the middle of the room. if you haven't felled the spear knight by this time you can easily get swarmed. the three main magical attacks the spear knight performs are as follows; a powered up lunge with the spear that the knight charges you with. the timing to counter this is difficult to place, and later than you'd think. if caught, it pierces you and raises you into the air, dealing heavy damage and applying the scarlet rot status effect. the second magical attack is if you continue to swipe at it at close range whilst it is crossing the sword and spear, it can blast magical energy outwards. this blast has a very small aoe, so as long as you don't get greedy with your attacks and get caught mid-animation, you can easily roll out of the blast radius. the final magical attack is where the knight swipes its spear along the floor 90 degrees whilst dashing backward. the area the spear swiped over will then begin to glow, shortly after which spectral spears will shoot from the floor. aside from the magical spear lunge, this attack is the most devastating damage-wise. the knight wielding the sickle can perform regular swipes with its sickle or sword, but can also imbue the sickle with magic and fling spinning magic discs at you with each swing of the sickle. these lock on to your position, and therefore must be dodge-rolled through at the last possible second. they come in twos, so keep rolling if you see a disc flying in your direction. it can also perform 360-degree spins with the sickle, punishing you for keeping too close or for continuing to try to get around behind it. this knight is very capable of quickly killing any spirits you summon, so towards the end of the fight (where hopefully it's just the sickle knight left), you're unlikely to have a way of distracting him without leaving yourself briefly vulnerable resummoning or the like. a final move the sickle knight can perform is a vomit of scarlet rot. it will splash out in a small pool in front of it which is easily avoidable so long as you spot the animation of the knight retching its head backward. if you aren't in the zone of the floor that it hits, you won't get splash damage or anything so you can keep wailing worry-free. upon defeating both cleanrot knights, you'll earn the gold scarab . /n sellia hideaway is one of the minor dungeons found in the caelid region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few treasure items and a miniboss foe. this page contains information on the location, walkthrough, and guide to traverse this dungeon, locate all of its treasure, and tips

you'll want to head north of the church of the plague. passing up the ridge, you'll spot a set of tombstones with a sorcerer amongst them. behind the largest of the tombstones, head to the cliff and strike it to reveal it to be an illusory wall. continue through the tunnel beyond and you'll happen upon a site of grace. just to the right of the site of grace is a crystal cave moss plant. down the tunnel is a new cave with a crystal miner sat down to the right, with a budding cave moss plant to the left. as you follow the tunnel curving round to the right, there will be two budding cave moss plants ahead of you as well as a corpse holding a golden rune (3). to the southwest, just before the dead-end alcove with the corpse, is a passageway. moving through it, there will be another crystal miner and a crystal cave moss plant. backtrack to the alcove with the corpse, and roll through the central cluster of smaller crystals at the back and strike the rock to reveal another illusory wall. behind it is a crystal miner, and at the end of that tunnel is another illusory wall. you'll now find yourself in a cave with giant crystals, and as you pass along the right-hand side ridge, a crystal miner will ambush you from an alcove on the right. walk across the large crystal and jump down to the left and face the crystal miner up on the ridge, then loot the golden rune (5) off the corpse. jump back over the crystals to the entrance of the room, get back on the large crystal and instead now jump to the right and face a crystal miner sorcerer. perform a running jump to the left to face three crystal snails. loop around the northeast ledge and you'll find two crystal miners around a fire. defeat them and loot the glowstone from the corpse nearby. perform a running jump across the gap, head down the path and loop around to kill the snails lower down on the crystals. dropping all the way down from these lower crystals, head to the southwest corner, up the ramp of crystals, and jump over the top to face a crystal miner and a scion-like creature. the three corpses in this space hold stimulating boluses , a golden rune (5), and the lost ashes of war . to the northwest you can jump up and exit this area, collecting the silver firefly clusters as you go. near the top of this tunnel is another corpse with a somber smithing stone (4). head all the way back to the highest northwest corner and follow the tunnel into a large cave jam-packed with crystals. there is a crystal snail just below you, and after dealing with it head to the back corner in the northwest to collect the preserving boluses off the corpse. just to the left of the corpse is another illusory wall, behind which is a chest that contains the crystal spear . heading all the way down the slope to the bottom of this cave, there's a corpse with a crystal dart x2. now make your way back up to the top of the room, and to the northeast, there will be a crystal you can walk along, then jump from crystal to crystal till you reach a hidden cave to the southwest. once there, drop down onto the platform below, then into the well-lit cave beneath that. there will be a twinsage sorcerer and two glintstone soldiers with swords and shields. beating them, prioritizing the sorcerer if you can, there is a chest with the crystalian ashes inside. to the southwest is a tunnel leading down to a drop-off with a crystal miner - dropping from which allows you to turn left and head towards the mist wall in the distance. be careful, however, as 4 crystal snails will drop from the ceiling as you progress through this room. like the crystalian in raya lucaria crystal tunnel , and the crystalian duo in academy crystal cave , this fight brings all three variants of the crystalians together. one crystalian wields a spear, one wields a spellcasting staff, and the third wields a ringblade. the uniqueness of these crystalians is their "putrid" namesake. all attacks from these crystalians inflict scarlet rot should they hit you. this can very quickly end an attempt if you get caught in a flurry of attacks, particularly if all three crystalians swarm you with no distractions available. as such, it's heavily recommended to utilize spirit ashes to draw one or more of the crystalians away from you, allowing breathing room, time to heal, or the ability to focus on one crystalian without needing your head to be on a swivel. the crystalian with the ring blade can extend its arms out to the side and begin spinning furiously, acting as a spinning top darting around the arena. so long as you keep your distance, it's uncommon for this move to target you so directly that it will definitely hit you. a few dodge-rolls or seconds of sprinting in the opposite direction to the boss will give you the space that you need. another combo attack is a three-move combo, where the crystalian will swipe its larger disc slowly from side to side, then winding up to launch the disc along the floor in your direction. the swipes are slow enough that you can gain space before they make contact, and if you dodge-roll diagonally towards the crystalian as it winds up for the disc roll you can guarantee you won't get hit, as the disc spins wildly enough trying to stay locked on to you that you can easily get behind the boss and perform a critical strike. the crystalian with the spear can prove to be the most aggressive and proactive with their attacks, but using a spirit ash like the mimic tear can consistently draw its attention off of you and subsequently let you defeat the other two crystalians (who work more at range). it will jab repeatedly at you, moving across the room in your direction, and can perform sweeps and a jumping slam with the spear. whilst they deal a lot of damage, they are slowly executed animations so shouldn't prove too difficult to dodge if you stay vigilant. after it has performed one of these attack animations, it should be similarly easy for you to get behind it and perform a backstab critical strike. when it comes to the spellcasting crystalian, you can again loop around the back of it and critical strike it. most of its attacks are negligible if you are up close and personal, but do your best to stay away from the front of the enemy. the most devastating attack it has is telegraphed very heavily but can one-shot you if you're not careful. it is particularly difficult if you aren't able to divert its attention whilst dealing with the spear crystalian. the attack in question is signaled when the crystalian pulls back its staff to one side as it begins glowing and building with blue energy, before firing out a continuous stream of crystal shards. the closer you are, the harder these are to avoid upon defeating the putrid crystalians, you'll earn the crystal torrent spell. /n war-dead catacombs is one of the minor dungeons found in the caelid region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few treasure items and a miniboss foe. this page contains information on the location, walkthrough, and guide to traverse this dungeon, locate all of its treasure, and tips to defeat the enemies within. enemies boss notable

starscourge radahn , head to the extreme north of the beach, and buried into the cliff-face on the coast to the east is a set of double doors. passing through, head down the stairs to reach a site of grace. after descending the stairs past the site of grace, you'll enter a large room with cleanrot knight spirits and godrick knight spirits battling each other. you can sit out this conflict for a while to gain some free runes should they kill some of their number. these spirits also respawn upon death, so whilst it makes for difficult traversal of the room, it can act as a solid rune farm if you're strong enough to continually defeat the ghosts. the corpse on the floor in the center of the room holds magic grease x3, and you can find ghost glovewort (6) plants dotted around the room, particularly on the lower level (though be wary as this is filled with scarlet rot inducing liquid). down the stairs on the opposite end of the room are the locked doors to the boss. to the right of this passageway is a staircase leading up and looping around the north side of the room. you can enter a tunnel up there, but be wary of the archer spirit across the way who will immediately take aim at you. heading into this tunnel on the left-hand side, another archer will be at the far end of the corridor, as well as a warrior. it's recommended to roll into the room with the warrior and fight him on the sides, negating the chances of the archer hitting you. continuing around after defeating the archer, you'll come to a room with two measly spirits sat down and a grave glovewort (6) plant. as you reach the next turn in the corridor a warrior wielding a two-handed sword will apparate, and once he's dealt with you'll turn the corner to see a red-crested soldier spirit sat down at the far end. as you head into the room just ahead of the red-crested soldier, another warrior spirit will ambush you from the right-hand side, so be ready to parry or roll out of the way of their slashes. in the middle right alcove of the room you'll find a grave violet plant. upon luring out and defeating the red-crested soldier with its spear and shield, you can grab the grave glovewort (6) and grave violet plants in the room he was in. from there, backtrack out to the previous room and turn into the alcove on the left and jump through the arched window opening. here you'll be on one of the upper floors of the central room leading to the lever. the reason to not jump through any of the previous window openings in the corridor above is due to the fact that there are no stairs to climb to this higher floor, so start here and you can always head down afterwards. up the stairs to the left you'll face 4 fanged imps (who don't appear to all provoke unless you attack each individual one), as well as a cleanrot knight who will emerge from the scarlet rot-filled room at the top. you can lure the cleanrot knight down the stairs and near the drop-off to the lower section to avoid having to down with it now if you time your dodges correctly during one of its charges with its spear. the corpse in the room at the top of the stairs holds the radahn soldier ashes . just outside of the room is another arched window opening. jump through it to grab the grave glovewort (6) plant, and around the corner to the left is the lever. after pulling it, grab the grave violet plant just to the southeast. jump back through the window opening, and drop down to the lower level with the large statue. a fanged imp is on the far wall, and an imp with a two-handed blade is tucked around the back of the statue. at the back of the sheltered area behind the statue is a ghost glovewort (4). heading through the tunnel on this lowest level, you'll emerge at the base floor of the room where the large fight was occuring. this is filled with scarlet rot so be wary of your health, and use preserving boluses if you have some. the corpse on the far end holds a silver-pickled fowl foot . there is also a chest close to the two roaming spirits on this floor that contains the collapsing stars spell. head back up the stairs in the southeast corner (retreating to, and resting at the site of grace near the entrance if you need to), then return to the locked doors to make your way past them and down the steps to a mist wall. similar to the ulcerated tree spirit in fringefolk hero's grave, the unique aspect of the putrid tree spirit is that the fire attacks of other tree spirits have been swapped for the same attacks imbuing scarlet rot. this tree spirit, like the others, is a highly aggressive, incredibly fast-moving enemy and due to its size, it can be very easy to have the game's camera work against you, particularly if lock-on is used. the tree spirit often has long wind-ups to its attacks but executes them very quickly so can take you by surprise. an example would be the chain of lunging bites that it performs, where it retreats to the opposite side of the arena, and will swing its mouth left and right 3 times, each time requiring a well-placed dodge. as a rule of thumb, you'll want to try and stick to the sides of the boss, rather than the back, as this is the most effective place to dodge-roll out of many of its attacks, including 180-degree spins with its tail. the scarlet rot attacks are when it breathes red fire in front of itself as it moves in a line across the arena, or a grab attack where it rears back and quickly lunges forward to grab you with its mouth, subsequently breathing fire on you as you're there, before slamming you to the ground. a major fire-based attack to be extremely cautious of is when the spirit begins to emanate flames all over its body in a red aura before exploding out in a large sphere. if you see the spirit begin this animation, sprint or dodge-roll as far away as possible to avoid being blown off your feet and taking extensive damage. swipes with its arms are often followed up immediately with tail swings, so be ready for quick follow-up attacks throughout this encounter. as you're sticking to the sides of the boss, the main attack to watch out for is stomps it performs with its arms. upon defeating the putrid tree spirit, you'll earn the redmane knight ogha ashes, as well as a golden seed . /n dragonbarrow cave is one of the minor dungeons found in the caelid region in elden ring. it is an optional

talisman +2 just to the north of the minor erdtree in dragonbarrow, you'll see a lower road occupied by a couple of bears. tucked into the rock face is the entrance to the cave, close to the second bear you'll encounter coming down the road from the west. the entrance isn't signposted with a brazier or anything, so can be easily overlooked. hug the rock face as you go along the path and you'll find it. traveling in through a small tunnel you'll find a site of grace. beyond the site of grace, down a small tunnel, you'll emerge into a cave filled with bushes and a patrolling runebear. there are a number of rowa fruit bushes throughout this cave, and to the southwest is two corpses holding a golden rune (12) and a warming stone respectively. in the next section of the cave to the left, there are two erdleaf flower and a crystal bud plant to the southwest. you can then progress down a slope to the southeast into a small room with filled with passive animals. there are silver firefly clusters on the floor, alongside rowa fruit and erdleaf flower plants. there is a crystal bud near the tree on the right, and the bull-goat's talisman on the corpse. backtrack to the first section of the cave and you'll see a hidden alcove to the north with a drop-off. jump down to the lower platform, then onto the next one down to grab some budding cave moss . there is a tunnel to the south on this level, where two wolves reside in the bend of the tunnel next to a budding cave moss plant. follow the tunnel down further to emerge at the base level where you'll face two wolves and a direwolf. there is a corpse in the center of the room that holds a golden rune (8) , and a corpse to the northwest that holds beast blood x3 . move down the tunnel to the east to arrive at another hole in the ground. drop from platform to platform and the last fall will land you in the boss arena. if you immediately crouch upon landing, because you're in a bush, you can engage stealth and prepare your moves for when you're ready. like other versions of the beastman of farum azula you are likely to have encountered thus far, but this time it's a duo fight. one beastman wields a greatsword and the other wields a throwing knife. the beastman with the greatsword is the more aggressive of the two, actively coming for you with swipes and slams. the best way to manage this fight is to immediately summon a mimic tear ash, and focus solely on jumping heavy attacks. because the beastman with the greatsword will come for you and the other beastman will hang back, the mimic will focus on the greatsword beastman too. this can very quickly lead to a stagger where you can loop the strategy without much interference and get critical hits in, felling the beast within half a minute, given you have a weapon of at least +9. with the greatsword beastman out of the way, the beastman with the throwing knife shouldn't prove too much of an issue. throughout the fight thus far, it will have been periodically throwing curved knives in your direction. as you charge the beastman down, they will swipe at you with their knife, but the exact same strategy from the other beastman can be applied here. after killing both beastmen, you'll earn the flamedrake talisman +2 . /n elden ring features a large variety of different types of dungeons, and unlike previous from software titles, most of

southwest of which is a lower section of land. in the northern rockface of this lower section (facing perfumer's ruins), you'll find an imp seal doorway. using a stonesword key to unlock the imp seal, open the doors and head down the first flight of stairs to reach a site of grace. down the steps from the site of grace, you'll enter a room with two misbegotten. one is on the far side of the room led down, and the other is tucked in the central alcove on the right. progressing on, you'll come upon a room with two larger axe-wielding misbegotten. one will be patrolling on the right, with the other tucked in a hallway to the left. looping around this hallway (left or right), you'll find a grave glovewort (6) plant. heading down the flight of stairs with the chasm either side, grab the grave violet plant from the southeast corner, being careful to dodge/parry the misbegotten that will leap from the right to ambush you as you reach the bottom of the stairs. continuing down the tunnel, there will be another room with alcoves either side. there is a large axe-wielding misbegotten resting alongside a dog on the far end, next to a grave glovewort (5) plant. the middle alcove on the right is a continuation of the path, so head in that direction. you'll reach an open space with two flights of stairs; a similar stairway you will have seen in other dungeons. unlike others however, you can actually drop down into the usual chasm space to reach a lower level. before doing so, continue round the path and deal with the misbegotten patrolling. further down the steps is a darkened room with a grave glovewort (4) in the center, and a misbegotten kneeled down beside it. after dealing with it, you'll note the room with the locked doors beyond, where there is a grave violet tucked in the immediate right corner. as you exit back out, be careful as an ogre will drop from the floor above. after dealing with it, backtrack and drop down the chasm next to the two flights of stairs and you'll be surrounded by misbegotten corpses. some of these will actually be resting, so test with your lock-on to be able to deal with most of them before they awaken. the corpse against the south wall in this corpse pit holds the winged misbegotten ashes , and is right next to a ghost glovewort (5) . head through the tunnel in this area, and up the stairs to reach the lever. after pulling it, loop around the hallway to the left to find a corpse halfway along that holds a rune arc . continuing down the corridor, a corpse will be hanging off the ledge as you turn right around the corner, and this corpse has the prattling pate (apologies) . you can then drop down and head left into the room, through the unlocked doors, and down the stairs to the mist wall. a duo boss fight, it's evenly balanced as you have one melee foe and one who operates more at range. the misbegotten warrior is identical to the leonine misbegotten from castle morne , and the other misbegotten warrior from redmane castle . capable of closing short distances very quickly, efficient and conservative use of your stamina bar will be key to your success. one of its main attacks is a four-move combo, involving three swings back and forth with its sword, finishing with an overhead vertical slam. again, with the speed of this opponent, it will be very difficult to keep any kind of distance between the two of you, so dodge-rolling through the swings and away from the slam are essential. if you're confident in parrying, you can interrupt any of the swings bar the final slam so attempt to get a critical strike there if you think you can execute the timing. it can also get on all fours and launch towards you with a swing, then a 360-degree spin into a launch into the air and stabbing its sword into the ground. the stab with the sword has a lock-on that is best countered by staying underneath the beast as it's in the air and rolling at the last second; your i-frames will help with the resulting shockwave. the beast can swipe with its left hand back and forth, then jump into the air, grab both ends of its sword and slam it down creating a larger shockwave, which is easy to avoid by rolling backward as the sword hits the ground. also be aware that the beast can roar, which will damage you slightly and can even stagger you if your build isn't dexterous enough. with dashing swipes at longer distances, the beast is best faced aggressively. a brutal move to watch out for at close range is a foot stomp, that immediately leads into two 360-degree spins with the sword. this above any other attack in this fight has the highest chance of killing you outright, as if you get caught during the first spin you will be hit by the second. you can block the foot stomp with minor impact on your stamina, but be prepared to immediately execute two dodge-rolls to evade the swings. perfumer tricia is very similar to a swordstress, with a focus on throwing various vapours and dust clouds that apply various ailments and status effects in the area they are cast. these include, but are not limited to, fire, poison and death clouds. luckily, they have a very small impact radius and if you utilise a spirit ash that can take a few hits you can easily get behind tricia and backstab her. with a weapon of +10 or more, you can fell her in three or four attacks. with the relatively passive nature of tricia in comparison, focus your efforts on the misbegotten warrior first. clearing it out, the last bit of the fight should be a breeze. upon defeating both the misbegotten warrior and perfumer tricia, you'll earn the perfumer tricia ashes. /n sage's cave is one of the minor dungeons found in the altus plateau region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few

through a small tunnel to reach a site of grace. beyond the site of grace, head down the tunnel grabbing the crystal cave moss as you go. when you reach the dead end, strike the wall in front of you to reveal an illusory wall with a chamber behind it. you can pick up two budding cave moss plants on either side of the room, before following the water downstream to a waterfall. to the right will be a skeleton with a spear, so be careful that it doesn't successfully ambush you as you emerge into this space. there is a budding cave moss plant against the wall on the right, and if you strike the wall just to the right of the budding cave moss, another illusory wall will be revealed. heading through this new passage, you'll happen upon two chests. one has the lost ashes of war , and the other has rejuvenating boluses x5 . past the chests are two corpses in the water below, both holding a golden rune (5) each. you'll also spot some silver firefly resting on the rocks nearby. you now have two paths to choose from; follow the darkened path to the south, or strike the wall to the east between the two braziers to reveal an illusory wall. striking this east wall, you'll immediately encounter 4 skeletons who will rush you from behind the illusory wall; one with a spear, the other three dual-wielding swords. it can be very easy to get overwhelmed/surrounded here, so get some distance and funnel them up the slope towards the chests you've just opened. once they are defeated, head up through the illusory wall they came from and you'll find a budding cave moss plant as well as four chests. one holds silver-pickled fowl foot x5 , one holds a black hood , one holds a candletree wooden shield , and the fourth holds a nascent butterfly . now heading down the darkened path to the south, you'll traverse a long narrow tunnel before opening out into a room that has four skeletons inside; two crossbowmen to the right, and a spearman and a larger axe-wielding skeleton to the left. it's a good idea to get the attention of the large skeleton and lure it backward into the tunnel you came from and deal with it one on one. the others should be easy to clear. the skeleton with the spear is facing a wall, and if you strike that wall a chest will be revealed behind it. inside that chest is a stonesword key . now head up the slope to the northeast, finding some crystal cave moss as you reach the top, as well as 3 additional chests, two to the right, and one in an alcove on the left. the chest on the left contains golden great arrow x10 , and the chests on the right hold dragonwound grease and the raptor talons respectively. continue through the tunnel northwest to emerge beneath the waterfall. jump over the gap to the left and continue around, making sure to drop down into the alcove on the left, grab the budding cave moss , and strike the back wall to reveal another chamber with two chests. one holds the raptor's black feathers , and the other the skeletal mask . if you strike the northwest corner of the cave, you'll reveal a small tunnel leading down to a mist wall. a human sorcerer, necromancer garris will cast a number of spells, summoning spectral skeleton skulls that fly towards you and deal damage upon contact. you'll also note a large skull that can roll around and swipe at you with its two tendrils. it's a good idea to deal with the rolling skull first, to prevent it from rolling into you as you focus on garris. and with the skull down, garris shouldn't prove too much trouble so long as you keep up close and personal with him. being in close proximity allows you to hit him as he is beginning a spell, interrupting the animation and canceling the attack altogether. garris can also raise his flail (which he also uses to spell cast) and slam it into the ground, summoning some full spectral skeletons that swipe at you before disappearing. garris also can perform regular melee attacks with this flail, but most of these attacks can also be interrupted by attacking as he begins to swing. after defeating necromancer garris, you'll earn the family heads weapon. backtrack out of the boss room, and when you reach the waterfall, turn left and follow the path around to find another mist wall down a slope to the left. at this point in the game, you are likely to have faced one of the black knife assassins in black knife catacombs or deathtouched catacombs . the caveat here is that the black knife assassin is completely invisible. this black knife assassin can therefore sneak up to you and perform a grab attack where it plunges its knife into your chest. all other attacks it performs are regular slashes and swipes with the knife. due to the invisibility, you can't lock on to the assassin, and it also can spectral dash around the arena like the other black knife assassins. with this hurdle, you might be inclined to swing wildly till you make contact. it's actually recommended to stay in the center of the arena as you can monitor the water for the splashes in the water caused by the footsteps of the assassin. another foolproof tactic is the use of a spirit ash, preferably something strong like the mimic tear ash, as they will ignore the fact that the assassin is invisible and consistently bee-line to them, allowing you to keep track of their exact position far easier. the spirit ash can also draw the assassin's attention away, meaning you're more likely to get some hits in without the assassin targeting you back. after defeating the black knife assassin, you'll earn the concealing vein . /n perfumer's grotto

left-hand side of the stairs, and past some runebears, the area will narrow down and you'll encounter a miranda flower on the left. after defeating it, you'll note it was in front of an entryway to a cave. heading inside, you'll find a site of grace almost immediately. beyond the site of grace, you'll be heading through a very long winding tunnel that will eventually open out into a dark cave. there are budding cave moss plants lining the walls and floor of the cave, and after sneaking around the corner, you can backstab the perfumer on the ledge. there are three more perfumers on the floor below, along with a miranda flower. in the pool that the miranda flower is in are a bunch of silver firefly to the right, and a corpse in the water that holds living jar shard x5 . heading to the north end of the cave, go down through the tunnel and find another miranda flower below you, along with a perfumer and two miranda sprouts. after clearing the room, jump southwest over the wooden slope to find a small area with budding cave moss plants and two chests; one contains a perfume bottle , the other living jar shard x10 . now head down the sloping tunnel to the north and you'll emerge in a gigantic cavern with a malformed star dangling from the ceiling to the left. either take out the star with ranged attacks, or carefully plan your dodge-rolls to evade their meteoric attacks. the corpse on the branch holds arteria leaf x3 . you can drop onto the lower branch to the left and perform a running jump up to reach a platform with a budding cave moss plant. continuing west, you'll see the mist wall past a darkened room filled with foliage. there are two miranda sprouts in here, as well as four corpses, one holding miranda powder , one holding a warming stone , and the last two holding a golden rune (5) each. a duo boss fight, miranda the blighted bloom and omenkiller provide two different combat strategies; miranda the blighted bloom remains in place and, like other miranda flowers, creates aoe spore clouds and summons beams of light from above. the omenkiller is a melee opponent, pursuing you relentlessly with dual-wielded cleavers. miranda the blighted bloom presents no unique elements to other miranda flowers (you had to deal with one to even access this dungeon, and within the dungeon itself), so just be aware of when it furls up and prepares to create a poison spore cloud, or stretches upwards to summon the white beams of light that fire down on your position. though omenkiler is the more aggressive of the two bosses, it's probably recommendable to take out miranda first so you can guarantee you have the ability to freely traverse the entirety of the arena. omenkiller is a warrior with a stone head mask and double cleavers, who focuses on swipes with its blades, and most commonly performs overhead jumping slams in sets of three. don't fret if one catches you - though you'll stagger slightly, you'll be able to escape the rest with a dodge-roll before the next slam connects. omenkiller can also breathe fire on the ground in a small sphere in front of itself, so if you are up close and personal (which is hard not to be) then be prepared to get around the sides/back of omenkiller during this animation, where you can also consistently get a backstab critical strike in. upon defeating both omenkiller and miranda the blighted bloom, you'll earn the great omenkiller cleaver . /n altus tunnel is one of the minor dungeons found in the altus plateau region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few treasure items and a miniboss foe. this page contains information on the location, walkthrough, and guide to traverse this dungeon, locate all of its treasure, and tips to defeat the enemies within. enemies

veil relatively central in the altus plateau, head south from the minor erdtree, and tucked in the alcove along the cliff face is the entrance to this mine. head inside and ride the lift at the end of the tunnel down, and you'll arrive at a site of grace. beyond the site of grace, you'll have two paths to take. head right and face off a marionette gargoyle and a crystal miner sorcerer. they will be guarding a chest that contains a rune arc . in the western corner of the room behind a collection of barrels is a smithing stone (5) deposit. heading back out and turning right, there will be a crystal miner sorcerer on the left. turning into the room on the right, there will be three crystal snails, as well as a corpse holding crystal dart x5 , and some cracked crystal deposits along the back wall. heading out of the room and turning right again, continue down the tunnel to enter a mining cave. there are a number of cracked crystal and smithing stone deposits around the room, so be sure to collect them all. as you head further into this cave, three marionette gargoyles will descend from the platform up on the left. there are a number of paths you can take from here; a tunnel to the south, a tunnel to the east, or loop up the wooden stairs to the platform above. heading up the stairs onto the platform, a marionette gargoyle will drop from the ceiling as you curve around to the south, as well as a crystal miner sorcerer in the dead-end beyond. the corpse in this dead-end holds an arteria leaf x2 . go back down the stairs and take the tunnel to the south. you'll emerge in a gigantic cavern (familiar if you have explored perfumer's grotto, as you're now on the opposite side that you could see as you dealt with the malformed star). turn right and deal with the crystal snail, who is guarding a corpse that contains a golden rune (7) . you can then drop off of the ledge onto the branch below, and climb up to the very top to reach a platform with a dangling corpse that holds the arsenal charm +1 . you can then drop down one level and backtrack through the tunnel to the mining cave. now take the tunnel to the east to face a room full of crystal snails, beyond which is a large set of double doors leading to a boss fight. crystalians are likely to be a familiar boss by the time you reach this portion of the game, but if not, you'll want to ensure you have a strike or pierce weapon to prevent your weapons (particularly slash) from bouncing off and dealing minimal damage. this is a duo boss fight, where one crystalian wields a spear and the other wields a ringblade. the crystalian with the spear can prove to be the most aggressive and proactive with their attacks, but using a spirit ash like the mimic tear can consistently draw its attention off of you and subsequently let you defeat the other two crystalians (who work more at range). it will jab repeatedly at you, moving across the room in your direction, and can perform sweeps and a jumping slam with the spear. whilst they deal a lot of damage, they are slowly executed animations so shouldn't prove too difficult to dodge if you stay vigilant. after it has performed one of these attack animations, it should be similarly easy for you to get behind it and perform a backstab critical strike. the crystalian with the ring blade can extend its arms out to the side and begin spinning furiously, acting as a spinning top darting around the arena. so long as you keep your distance, it's uncommon for this move to target you so directly that it will definitely hit you. a few dodge-rolls or seconds of sprinting in the opposite direction to the boss will give you the space that you need. another combo attack is a three-move combo, where the crystalian will swipe its larger disc slowly from side to side, then winding up to launch the disc along the floor in your direction. the swipes are slow enough that you can gain space before they make contact, and if you dodge-roll diagonally towards the crystalian as it winds up for the disc roll you can guarantee you won't get hit, as the disc spins wildly enough trying to stay locked on to you that you can easily get behind the boss and perform a critical strike. upon defeating both crystalians, you'll earn the somberstone miner's bell bearing (2) . /n sealed tunnel is one of the minor dungeons found in the altus plateau region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few treasure items and a miniboss foe. this page contains information on the location, walkthrough, and guide to traverse this

to the slope leading down to the water, then travel to the southern end of this body of water. buried in the western cliff face, you'll spot an entryway to this tunnel. upon heading inside and passing through a small tunnel, you'll find a site of grace. beyond the site of grace, you'll want to strike the wall on the western side, to the left of the brazier, to reveal an illusory wall. behind it is a cave filled with stonediggers. deal with the one to your right, and then head up the wooden steps wrapped around the center column in the room to find a corpse holding a golden rune (5) . dropping off the edge, a vulgar militant is hiding behind the platform so deal with it, likely after it has thrown a smoke bomb. in the southwest corner of the room is a chest containing the smithing-stone miner's bell bearing (2) . in the southeastern region of the room are four more stonediggers, mining various cracked crystal deposits as well as a few smithing stone (6) spots. return to the southwestern corner where the chest is and strike the wall behind the chest to reveal another illusory wall. pass through the tunnel beyond to find a lift. ride it down, then head forward and strike the dead-end wall amongst the tree roots. at the next dead end down the slope is a corpse with a golden rune (5) , and another illusory wall behind it. this will open out into another larger cave, and walk across the branch, drop onto the branch lower on the left and grab the gold-pickled fowl foot off of the corpse. whilst still on this branch, turn to the southwest and head to the wooden platform. pass through the tunnel to the left and fight a vulgar militant guarding a corpse with a stonesword key . head back out onto the branch and drop down to fight off more vulgar militants and a pendulum statue. there is a somber smithing stone (5) deposit in the northwest corner, and three corpses on the floor; one has a rune arc , one has furlcalling finger remedy x3 , and the last holds a golden rune (1) . head up the ladder and cross back over the branches progressing towards the tunnel to the east. there you'll find massive roots blocking a staircase, so drop down on the right-hand side to land amongst some abnormal rock clusters, that will explode promptly so run/roll away asap. there is a corpse beneath the stairs that holds a grace mimic x5 . head up the stairs to find more abnormal stone clusters, and a corpse beneath the roots on the left carrying an old fang x2 . up a slope in the northeast is a corpse holding large glinstone scrap x3 . to the southeast, behind a bunch of barrels, is another abnormal stone cluster. avoiding its explosion, then strike the wall behind it to reveal another illusory wall. you'll need to do some drops now, heading from branch to branch and platform to platform, grabbing the smithing stone (5) deposit as you go. there is a corpse up near the higher end of the largest root you land on that holds lightning grease x4 , but will require a running jump to reach. upon dropping all the way to the bottom, there will be four more abnormal stone clusters and a corpse that holds a golden rune (9) . proceeding through the tunnel, you'll arrive at a stone archway, through which is the boss arena. a humanoid enemy, the onyx lord has a combination of melee and magic based attacks. the majority are with its greatsword, that it will swipe with like many other greatsword-wielding enemies in elden ring. the onyx lord does have a tendency to perform sweeps with the blade that have an overly extended wind-up and range. as such, it can be easy to dodge/parry too early and get caught out, so keep a keen eye on its animations and act at the last moment. the onyx lord also performs a running maneuver where it rotates around the arena dragging its blade alongside it, before ending in a slash outwards. the onyx lord can also conjure dark magical orbs that it will throw from its hand which will knock you to the ground should they make contact. the deadliest attack is where the onyx lord will plunge its blade into the ground creating a small shockwave, followed by a large orb appearing above the onyx lord while it is stationary, from which are fired small comets. the amount can vary, so as a rule of thumb keep dodging until you know for sure that the barrage has ended. whilst in a one-on-one scenario the onyx lord can prevent some challenges, this fight can be made a cakewalk using the mimic tear ashes. summoning another version of yourself will consistently draw the attention of the onyx lord (and all of its magical attacks) on the mimic and not you. as such, when it performs the ground stab and the comets begin firing, they will mostly target your mimic if you've kept your distance prior to the attack starting, so you can then take advantage and charge in to deal heavy damage while the onyx lord is stationary with its sword in the ground. upon defeating the onyx lord, you'll earn the onyx lord's greatsword . you can then either take the wisp of light to teleport back to the dungeon's entrance, or continue through the stone archway to advance to the divine tower of west altus. /n auriza side tomb is one of the minor dungeons found in the altus plateau region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few treasure items and a miniboss foe. this page contains information on the location, walkthrough, and guide to traverse this dungeon, locate all of its treasure, and tips to defeat the enemies within. enemies boss notable loot living jars, exploding living jars, giant living jars, fanged imps grave warden duelist cracked pot x4, ritual pot , perfumer's cookbook 3 after heading through the main capital gate in the altus plateau to the capital outskirts, continue along the path to the far northeast where the entrance to lenydell, capital city is guarded by a draconic tree sentinel. if you search the nearby ridge, you can find a statue pointing to the dungeon entrance straight down the cliff. return southwest to find a path below along the dried up moat and under the landbridge leading to the gate, and you can find the entrance to the auriza hero's grave on the right, and to the left you can spot the door to the side tomb past a large runebear that guards the entrance. there are two important things to take note of in this dungeon as you enter - one: some of the living jars can explode on you, and two: the dungeon hides a big secret within several teleporter traps. moving down past the sealed entrance to the boss, you'll be in a room with a patrolling living jar, but the two with yellow caps on the side are the ones you need to worry about - they can either ignite themselves and detonate after jumping toward you, or they'll explode a moment after death, so try to finish them off from a distance if possible or roll away. be sure to check around the room for a grave glovewort 6 , as well as a grave violet overlooking a window down to a larger chamber. take the other path out of this room to a dead end with the chest - but you'll find its actually a teleporter trap to take you deeper into the dungeon. exiting the trap you can grab another grave violet on your way to the big room you saw from the window earlier - a large chamber with an upper ledge that holds the lever to open the boss door, but it's out of reach. drop down and be ready to fight off two fanged imps that will rush you from under the far ledge, then turn around to look under the stairs you came down to find another fanged imp guarding a grave glovewort 6 . head left and get the grave glovewort 5 before going down the narrow stairs into a flooded part of the dungeon - but be wary of a fanged imp above you hurling electric pots. you can't open the gate in front of you, so move right instead and be ready to face a fanged imp ambush on the left as you enter a large chapel room. this large chapel room has another transporter chest at the far end guarded by a fanged imp, a blank wall on the left, and a ledge above you to the right where more fanged imps may hurl pots at you. ignore them and use the transporter trap to be warped again. you'll be transported to the other side of the flooded room where two large living jars wait - but you can try and take them on one by one if you stick to the right wall first and use strong attacks to stagger them. once both are dead, search the room to find 2 cracked pot and the perfumer's cookbook 3 . however, with no way out of the room, the only path seems to be the one you came from. back in the chapel room, search the blank wall recess on the side and strike it to reveal an illusory wall. this path leads down to yet another transporter trap - but two explosive living jars will try to bum rush you and explode, so bait them into diving and sprint backwards first, then grab the grave glovewort 5 . the teleporter trap here will take you to the ledge overlooking the chapel room, so be ready to defeat the two fanged imps up here and loot a nearby body for a golden rune 7 . when you move up the small stairs onto the ledge in the main chamber, you may notice something amiss: instead of a lever for the boss door, a fanged imp waits for you. this is your major clue that something is amiss in this dungeon. in truth, there are two seperate but nearly identical dungeons that the transporter traps are warping you between, and you're in the second version. you can further corroborate this by dropping down to the main floor of the large chamber to find the fanged imps are back, as are the grave glovewort 6 under the stairs - because you haven't looted these ones yet. you can also head up the stairs back towards the entrance to find the way back now has a room with a giant living jar guarding a ritual pot and 2 root resin . your next major clue comes from backtracking towards the chapel room - as you may notice the flooded room beyond holds items you haven't picked up - and a ladder. since you're in the alternate version of the dungeon, the same rules apply to most transporter destinations - use the chest at the back of the chapel to warp to this untouched flooded room. in this room, the two giant living jars have been replaced by two exploding living jars, and you can also loot 2 more cracked pot , and a ghost glovewort 6 . take the ladder up above this area, and you'll finally be back in the original dungeon with the ledge to the boss lever in front of you, by a grave glovewort 6 . now you can take the teleporter trap back up the stairs to the first part of the dungeon and retrace your steps to the boss room. the grave warden is thankfully a boss you've likely fought before, and the only new twist on this fight is that the room also holds a group of small living jars, but since they move rather slowly it's hard to get swarmed by them - though you can use a spirit summon to have them clear the adds while you focus on the grave warden. using his twin hammers, the grave warden will fight aggressively by constantly rushing you to swing both weapons, or try to pull you in with a single hammer swipe and drag. this boss also has some very long combo attack that vary in length, but usually end with swinging their hammer around on a chain - which you can dodge roll under to get close and unleash several attacks. don't get too greedy, or the grave warden may put both hammers in one hand in attempt to grab you with its free hand, and this grab cannot be blocked - but its range is short. after taking some damage, the grave warden will unleash a battle cry to bolster its damage output, but it can still be staggered by certain attacks, and has little armor or resistance to speak of. as long as you stay mobile or use your summon to draw aggro, you should be able to overpower the boss once its adds are taken care of. defeating the grave warden duelist will award you the soldjars of fortune ashes , a silly spirit summon that brings exploding allies to your aid. /n auriza hero's grave is one of the minor dungeons found in the altus plateau region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few treasure items

capital city is guarded by a draconic tree sentinel, and note the lower path below the entrance near a dried up moat. backtrack and advance through the lower path to find a large structure at the base of the capital walls to locate the elevator entrance to the dungeon. right off the bat, at the site of grace for this dungeon you can find an imp seal that requires 1 stonesword key, revealing a small room that holds the golden epitah sword - but it is guarded by three basilisks spraying death, so be wary! moving into the next room you'll enter a large sloping hallway, and as you might guess - a prelude to pain. at the end of the long slope a statue with a light beacon will summon a moving chariot death trap that will begin to race up and down the slope at high speeds. in order to survive, you'll need to duck into the alcoves as you progress, but you won't always be alone. as soon as the chariot appears, duck into the alcove on the left, or be prepared to fight two skeletons that appear on the right alcove (or try pushing them out to get killed). wait until the chariot moves past again to race down to the bottom of the slope - but wait by the archway pillars as a new chariot will come racing down the slope ahead. there's 5 fan daggers on a body nearby, but you'll have a choice on how to proceed. if consider yourself fast, you can start running just as the chariot begins to climb back up and duck into an alcove on the left or right before the top, but will have a very small window to get in safely. if this feels too risky, you can also drop down to a lower level by the archway - but you'll have to contend with several basilisks that burrow up to surround you. dodging the chariot will take you to a second long hallway where things get a bit trickier: the first chariot will soon follow you and chase you down this long slope on the right side - just as another chariot rockets up on the far side of the slope. because of this, you'll either have to continue using the alcoves - or play with fire by dodging between the two chariots by timing when they are going up or down. halfway down this slope, you can find two small paths below the slope that can give you some cover. the path on the right has a grave violet and a long tunnel leading back to some basilisks and a grave glovewort 5 , before a right turn leads to where that earlier drop led to, as well as a ghost glovewort 5 and grave glovewort 6 . the path in the middle of the slope has a stonesword key , and hides a skeleton guarding a ghost glovewort 6 . be wary as you run further down the slope towards as grave glovewort 6 , as there's only an alcove on the far left to take refuge in - already occupied by an angry skeleton. once you race down to the bottom, one final chariot will start rolling at you from a much shorter slope ahead, and there's a small space just in front of the left pillars to safely stand as you wait for it to go back up. the window to get past it is much shorter (though it is doable) - but there is a secret path you can take before proceeding to the boss. just in front of the slope leading past the chariot to the boss is a body dangling over a ledge holding a golden rune 7 . looking below, you can spot a network of wooden beams leading down to a new area. carefully drop down right where the body is lying to hit the first beam, and walk forward to drop down to a lower beam where another body holds 2 holy grease . from here you have two options, keep dropping down to the lowest level and move south, or drop down one level and move north. try going north first by dropping down to the next lowest beam and move all the way up and then right up a sloping beam. here you'll find a basilisk quickly flanked by two friends from two doorways nearby. kill them cautiously, then move through the doors and kill another one on the left. the passage to the right will contain a basilisk guarding grave glovewort 5 and vulgar militia ashes , and you can find a ladder opposite the ashes to take you back up above the final chariot and a grave violet - but we're not done down here yet. taking the lower path to drop down all the beams and head south, you'll have to sprint to the edge to get around a skeleton waiting at the end. climb the ladder and head through a tunnel to hear yet another chariot appear above you, and carefully poke your head out at the end of the tunnel. there's a chariot here going up and down fairly fast, so you won't have much time to quickly check the opposite tunnel for a skeleton, and then run up to a pathway on the right past the golden sigil on the floor. here you'll find grave glovewort 6 and a large flame trap pillar shooting fire off to the side, which doesn't appear to make much sense. hitting it will send the entire pillar even further up - but it will also send the statue emitting the sigil light up above as well, and that's the key (even if you can't see it). for this next step, it might be easier to just die, as you'll be coming back this way soon enough - but you can also try to outrun the chariot nearby. when you come back to the dungeon entrance, make your way to the area where the two chariots run side by side, and you'll now spot a new golden sigil along the middle of the slope that wasn't there before - created by you knocking the pillar upwards. this will spawn in a chariot on the platform as you approach, but the other two chariots will quickly crash into it and explode. this will destroy every single chariot in the dungeon, and award you for your clever efforts with the ash of war - holy ground , tree sentinel helm , tree sentinel armor , tree sentinel gauntlets , and tree sentinel greaves . with all the chariots out of the way, return to the slope with the flame trap pillar at the end, and go all the way down this time. you'll have to clear out two skeletons at the tunnel here, which will lead to a fork in the road. one path leads to an omen that attack viciously to guard a crucible feather talisman , while the other path leads to a lift back up to top of the flame trap pillar, and the main slope with 3 giant dragonfly head and ghost glovewort 6 . now you're free to run up the last small slope to the chamber before the boss room, where 3 skeletons stand guard (and thankfully a stake of marika should this next boss give you trouble). one crucible knight is enough of a pain, and this fight pits you against two of them. make no mistake, this will be a very hard fight for almost any build, and you may have to come back later if you're having trouble getting at least one of them down consistently. the regular crucible knight will be armed with a pronged spear, while ordovis will be armed with his signature greatsword that has a unique special attack skill. even if you've had practice dealing with one before, taking on two at once is nothing short of a pain due to the impossible reach of their weapons and hyper-aggressive attacking. for this reason, it is highly recommended that you bring in your most durable spirit summons to run interference - either grab both knights' attention long enough for you to get in major sweeping damage from behind, or try to blast down one of the knights while your summons holds their own against the second. we recommend the greatshield soldier ashes due to their ability withstand lots of attacks - even from a crucible knight. the regular crucible knight seems to have slightly less health and armor than ordovis, but both will be strong contenders, giving you little chance for counterattacks. if you've fought other crucible knights, you'll know they aren't weak to much, are rarely staggered, and can't be backstabbed. for this reason you'll want to pick your hits wisely and then be ready to dodge or block until the next window arrives. crucible knights usually get in 2-3 long attacks before a slight pause, giving you the chance to get in a single hit of your own (or a few more depending on your weapon speed). don't get greedy, and bait out attacks that you know you can punish with your own. the spear knight has a few quick pokes, and long sweeping blows with delayed hits you'll have to time before attacking back. it can also charge up its spear for a big magic attack that you'll need to expertly time to dodge. at half health, it will grow wings to use in a flying lunge you can dodge and retaliate, and can also spawn a forearm blade to skewer you that is very lethal and unblockable - so timing your dodges is key. ordovis on the other hand will often engage in 2-3 long swings at a time, or stomp into an overhand slam and two spinning slashes you can dodge if timed well. attacking after its 2-hit slashes, running thrust, or stomp and slam combo can give you small openings, as does its shield bash (but be wary of the delayed charge that can catch you if you dodge too early). ordovis can also utilize his unique greatsword ability to charge it up in a spinning slam attack that generates a small explosion. this is a good time to get a heal in if you need it, then a running jump attack as soon as the explosion is over to exploit the opening. at half health, ordovis will also grow wings and fly up for diving imapling swoop attacks you'll want to dodge. you may also want to quickly close the distance as he'll start using tail swipes after getting distance on you, with the second one covering a huge portion of the room you need to dodge over. at this point, many of his 2-hit combos can also incorporate a tail sweep you need to block or be ready to dodge at moments notice, giving you less chances to poke him back. as long as you can get one knight down before your summon dies, you can win this fight as long as you take things slow. if your summon dies early, you'll need to constantly backpedal and hope one knight overtakes the other to get close and opens themselves up with an attack you can poke back and get back to retreating - staying for a moment longer invites the other knight to catch you off-guard and the two will make quick work of you. defeat them both, and you'll gain the full crucible knight set, including the crucible axe helm , crucible axe armor , crucible gauntlets , and crucible greaves -- and ordovis's greatsword as well! /n leyndell catacombs is one of the minor dungeons found in the altus plateau region in elden ring.

treasure, and tips to defeat the enemies within. enemies boss notable loot rats/putrid corpses/ogres/zombies/fanged imps esgar, priest of blood crucible scale talisman , sacramental bud , lord of blood's exultation to reach leyndell catacombs, you'll need to access the sewers of leyndell. from the avenue balcony site of grace, head down the stairs, turn left, and jump down onto the roofs below. then across the courtyard, to the right of a destroyed building, will be a well to the north. jumping down/descending the ladder, you'll find a locked metal gate. this requires the sewer-gaol key that you can acquire from speaking to the dung eater at the table of lost grace hub. the dung eater will only give this key if you have acquired the seedbed curse . whilst there are multiple of these items throughout leyndell, the easiest to acquire is proceeding into the city from east capital rampart site of grace, and in the room where you first encounter a perfumer (just beyond the lift ride down), climb the ladder, then proceed up the stairs and loot the corpse sat on the chair in the center. with the seedbed curse and sewer-gaol key acquired, open the metal gate at the bottom of the well, go down the ladder beyond and follow the waterway into a room filled with 6 small rats. to the southeast are double doors. through them, drop off the ledge and on the left-side of the corridor is the underground roadside site of grace. from here, head down the ladder to the southeast to arrive in a room with large pipes, patrolled by fanged imps. proceed along to the other side of the room, head up the stairs past the wooden platform, and pull the lever over to the right to open part of a shortcut, raising the metal gate. backtrack and drop down onto the pipe below right next to the wooden platform. dropping down the base level, you'll encounter a water-logged area with two giant lobsters. sprint to the southeast where there is a hole in the wall, denoted by a brazier. head straight onto the lift to the southwest, and at the top face off against respawning spectral soldiers. rush to strike the wall to the right of the steps to reveal an illusory wall, then strike the back left corner in this new section to reveal an alcove with a lesser spirit-caller snail; upon killing which will clear all of the spectral soldiers. now follow the path up the steps to find a lever that will open a passageway to the right that takes you up through the floor - finishing the shortcut creation between the catacombs and the underground roadside site of grace. backtrack and ride the lift down, then turn left down the steps to find the leyndell catacombs site of grace. beyond the site of grace, head down the steps and turn left at the locked doors, down a corridor to enter a multi-level room with 4 zombies. two will drop down from a higher level, so be prepared. up the stairs to the southeast, you'll come to a fork in the path. to the left is a small room with zombies praying at a corpse. a third zombie is waiting to ambush you on the right as soon as you enter. the corpse in the room holds a ghost glovewort (6) . now taking the other path to the right, there will be a fire trap at the opposite end of the corridor, as well as 3 putrid corpses who will explode outwards if you don't defeat them in time, so be prepared to run clear if you are unable to fell them quickly enough. timing it between bursts of fire, sprint into the corridor and take refuge on the right, before heading to the trap and striking it to lower and disarm it. deal with the zombie in this room, then grab the grave violet in the back right corner. jump onto the top of the fire trap and strike it to raise it up, letting you reach a higher platform where you'll face off against an ogre defending a stand on the back wall that has the crucible scale talisman . backtrack down to the trap corridor and take the stairs up to the left (where you previously took refuge from the fire), to arrive in front of a large statue, up the stairs behind which is a patrolling ogre. dealing with it, grab the grave glovewort (9) plant against the east wall, and drop off the ledge in the next room, collecting the grave glovewort (8) off the coffin in the center. 3 zombies will emerge from the water, so don't let them grab you. now head northwest to find a second set of locked doors open, proceeding down the stairs beyond which will lead to what looks like a boss room, but in fact, just holds two ogres. one will be visible at the opposite end of the room, whilst the second waits to ambush you to your immediate right. it is heavily recommended to stay close to the stairs and lure the ambushing ogre back up the steps, preventing it from becoming a 2 vs 1 scenario. once both are defeated, grab the ghost glovewort (8) plant and the golden rune (11) off of the corpse. moving back out through the unlocked doors, continue northeast up the steps to grab the root resin x4 off of the corpse tucked behind the right coffin. now, backtrack all the way to the fire trap and once again ride it up to the higher platform. in the room beyond, a corridor to the right will have now appeared, at the end of which is a grave violet plant and two fanged imps patrolling the staircase beyond. at the bottom of the staircase is a ladder, and at the bottom of that ladder is a long corridor that finally leads to the higher level of the initial room of the catacombs, where you'll find the lever on the right, as well as a corpse holding sacramental bud x2 . dropping down to the lower level, head northwest and then turn left through the unlocked doors, down the steps to a mist wall. a small sorcerer, esgar wields a dagger that is magically imbued, capable of inflicting bleed. esgar is also joined by two dogs that can similarly inflict bleed with their bites. to begin the fight, summon any spirit ash you please to direct some attention from both the dogs and esgar off of you, which in turn enables you to eliminate the dogs as a priority. with the dogs gone, esgar shouldn't prove too much of a challenge. stabs and swipes make up the majority of their attacks and are telegraphed enough to make them either dodgeable or open to parry. the main attacks to be wary of involve spellcasting, where esgar creates a rune in front of themself and summons clouds of bleed-inflicting vapor. esgar can perform the same maneuver, but instead, the vapor cloud acts as a sphere that homes in on you, following you around until it either hits you or evaporates. upon defeating esgar, priest of blood, you'll earn the lord of blood's exultation . /n sainted hero's grave is one of the minor dungeons found in the altus plateau region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few treasure items and a miniboss foe. this page contains information on the location, walkthrough, and guide to traverse this dungeon, locate all of its treasure, and tips

dragoncrest shield talisman +1 , duelist greaves , prattling pate (let's get to it) , ancient dragon knight kristoff in central altus plateau lies a structure acting as a hero's grave, similar to others in the lands between. the easiest way to access it is via the windmill village in northern altus plateau, then curving around the outer wall of leyndell and up the ridge to reach the building. upon arrival, a black knife assassin will be waiting at the entrance. upon defeating it, you'll earn the black knife . lift the door to the building and ride the lift down. ahead of you at the bottom you'll find a site of grace. beyond the site of grace, you'll see an imp seal in the right corner at the back of the room. opening it with a stonesword key , you'll find an albinauric groveling over a corpse that holds the crimson seed talisman . now heading through the tunnel to the east, you can take the right turn at the fork in the path or carry on to the end of the corridor. at the end of the corridor, you'll arrive in a room with two albinaurics on the upper level across from you who will sling spells at you. kill them and grab the grave violet plant behind them. drop down and loop under the steps to face a revenant in front of a grave glovewort (5) plant. head back up the steps and strike the wall behind the grave violet to reveal an illusory wall. drop off of the ledge beyond to encounter a unique puzzle. you'll be in a corridor with fanged imps. you'll notice that they are shrouded in darkness and can't be hit. there is a sphere of light shining in the southwest corner which you'll need to draw the imps into to make them vulnerable. to the north is the steps leading up to the initial corridor (the opposite route you could have taken at the fork), so instead head east grabbing the grave violet plant before going down the stairs. in the room at the bottom, you'll need to run down the steps, past the two fanged imps and lure them around the corner to the right into the light sphere. take them out and grab the grave violet to the southeast. now head under the sheltered portion of the room to the left of the steps you just ran down after killing the albinauric patrolling the area to grab a grave glovewort (4) and a grave violet . continue east through the tunnel and down the steps to arrive in a dark room full of columns. loop around the outskirts of the room to grab the leyndell soldier ashes off the corpse across the way. then walk into the center of the room to cause the floor to collapse. 4 fanged imps will be in front of you, though thankfully you'll fall into a sphere of light so you can stay there, lure them and be able to deal with them without fear of being overwhelmed. in the southeast corner of the room you can grab a grave glovewort (3) plant, and then pull the lever to the north to open the gate. beyond, you'll see a large corridor with multiple dropping blades. this corridor is filled with zombies, but first, wait for the very first blade to drop and then get on top of it before it rises again to allow you to roll off onto a raised platform to the left. heading into the room up the steps, kill the four zombies and two albinaurics in the room, then open up the imp seal to grab a grave glovewort (5) , and then deal with the two zombies in the northwest corner surrounding a corpse that holds the dragoncrest shield talisman +1 . up the steps is a tunnel leading back to the room where the floor collapsed, but that isn't needed for now. backtrack out to the room with the blades, deal with the zombies wandering the space and be sure to grab the grave glovewort (4) on the right. around the corner at the end of the corridor is an albinauric on horseback, a couple more zombies, and some more dropping blades. you'll see the locked boss doors at the far end. in between the second and last blades around this corner, you'll see an alcove on the right that has a ladder. climb it and then drop down into the room beyond. as you approach the corpse on the left, a revenant will emerge from the floor. be sure to get some hits in as it is vulnerable whilst it's emerging. there is a grave glovewort (5) behind the corpse, and the corpse itself holds human bone shard x5 . follow the pathway to the west to arrive on the walkway above the blade corridor. grab the root resin x3 off the corpse hanging off the left side then walk up the stairs. at the top, you'll see a grave warden duelist shrouded in darkness. as such, you can't damage it till it's lured into a light sphere. you'll want to lure it onto the overpass, drop down and backtrack through the blade corridor to the line sphere where the collapsed floor is (to the south). upon bringing it into the light and defeating it, the boss doors will automatically unlock on the far end of the blade corridor, and you'll earn the duelist greaves . before proceeding through the boss doors, head back up the ladder and into the room where the grave warden duelist initially was to loot a corpse holding prattling pate (let's get to it) , as well as a ghost glovewort (4) and (5) plants to the back of the room. now drop down and head through the boss doors, down multiple sets of stairs (on which a zombie is waiting at the bottom of the second flight along with a grave glovewort (3) plant), and continue down to the mist wall. a highly agile warrior, the ancient hero of zamor focuses on slashing and spinning attacks, with a focus on aerial attacks. because of the agility, ranged/magic attacks are mostly ineffective. other than melee attacks, the hero of zamor will summon a blue light in its hand that telegraphs a small spherical explosion around itself that inflicts the frostbite status effect. during the first phase of the fight, you'll want to be particularly aggressive, as the second phase inversely requires heavily defensive play. the ancient hero will kneel and imbue its sword with frostbite when it reaches 50% health, making its attacks more potent across the board in the second phase. a particularly deadly one is a variant of the frostbite burst from the first phase, where the ancient hero will create a huge blizzard in a large radius around itself, from which it will spring out into a lunge attack. again, playing defensively is key here so time your strikes carefully at the end of the ancient hero's combos. because your attacks will be more dispersed, anything that can apply damaging status effects is recommended to help whittle down the hero's health even without you attacking. upon defeating the ancient hero of zamor, you'll earn the ancient dragon knight kristoff ashes . /n elden ring features a large variety of different types of dungeons, and unlike previous from software titles, most

enemies within. enemies boss notable loot fanged imps/leyndell knights erdtree burial watchdog lightning scorpion charm , ancient dragon apostle's cookbook 1 , glovewort picker's bell bearing 1 to the west of mt. gelmir, head northwest of wyndham ruins' marker on your map, and buried in the cliff face near the top are the double doors tucked behind some ruins and trees. through the doors and down the first flight of stairs you'll find a site of grace. beyond the site of grace, down the stairs you'll immediately come to the locked boss doors. grab the root resin on the left before proceeding. a passageway continues on the right, though be careful as there is a pressure plate directly in the center of your path, with the bolts (if triggered) coming from the spouts on the wall behind you. avoiding the pressure plate, ride the lift beyond down and head down the stairs to enter a larger room with a large blade rising and dropping in the center. at the far end are two fanged imps who will hurl electric bombs at you, but won't have the range unless you are around halfway across the room. avoiding the blade as it drops, grab the grave glovewort (4) plant in the center of the room, and deal with the fanged imps. continue through the hallway and as you reach the next room you'll face another two fanged imps; one is hanging on the far wall, and the other is waiting to ambush you to your immediate right. after dealing with them both, grab the grave glovewort (5) plant on the left and push onwards. down a narrow set of stairs, there will be a large sewer-type room, filled with 5 skeletal slimes that will drop from the ceiling as you enter, as well as some zombies roaming the far end. by the first right pillar is a grave violet plant, and a ghost glovewort (6) as you approach the metal gate, along with another grave violet plant tucked behind the pillar on the right. you can't pass the gate, so turn right and you'll see a leyndell knight across the water. the knight will electrify its sword, so be careful of attacks that will deal far more damage; some slams causing small aoe electric bursts. after dealing with it, there is a grave glovewort (4) plant on the right, and a ladder behind where the knight was initially stood. climb the ladder and you'll see an imp seal across the corridor. be wary of a pressure plate on the floor shortly after getting to the top, so walk around it, and as you approach the imp seal a fanged imp will drop from the ceiling to ambush you. having dealt with it, unlock the imp seal. behind it, you'll find a corpse on the opposite side of the coffin that holds the lightning scorpion charm . heading down the stairs, there is a room that acts as a trap. stepping out onto the floor begins raising it towards the spikes in the ceiling, so sprint across to the opposite side (where the fanged imp is), and get in the alcove before the floor slams into the ceiling. turn around 180 degrees to face where you came from and you'll see another alcove above the initial entrance with a fanged imp and a grave violet plant that you can sprint to if you wish. otherwise, the platform across from the entrance is where the lever is, along with a leyndell knight guarding it. to the immediate right is a fanged imp with a two-handed sword, so prepare for an ambush. if you lure it out back into the corridor you can defeat it without making the knight hostile, which furthermore allows you to sneak up to the knight and get a backstab in. with the lever pulled, you'll need to sprint across to the alcove above the initial entrance, then drop and roll back into the corridor. before you continue back up the stairs though, trigger the floor to rise and stay in the entryway. this will allow you to drop down into the water below the floor, and head through the tunnel to face some more zombies. be wary of the pressure plate in the center of the area, and as you approach the corpses across the way two giant crabs will spring from the water. you can get close to killing one of them as they are emerging, meaning you only have to deal with one by the time they are fully out and ready to attack. the corpses hold the ancient dragon apostle's cookbook (1) , a golden rune (5) , and magic grease x2 . you can then pull the lever to the right of the metal gate to open a shortcut, and allows you to sprint back to the now unlocked doors at the very beginning of the catacombs, leading down a staircase towards a mist wall. you will have likely encountered multiple variants of the erdtree burial watchdog at this point in the game, where this specific version is most in line with the sword-wielder you encounter in minor erdtree catacombs and impaler's catacombs . the unique caveat for this watchdog, if you hadn't guessed from the other electrically-imbued enemies in this dungeon, is that the watchdog wields electric-based attacks alongside its regular swipes, spins, sweeps, and slams. don't be fooled by its initial slow movements, as it can quickly lower its sword to thrust forward with decent range, or raise the sword high to slash down vertically, diagonally, or horizontally. if it slams its sword down to the side, it means that the boss is about to launch a spinning attack, which is your cue to backpedal out of range. many of its swings do take a few moments to charge up and cool down, giving you a brief chance to get some hits in of your own before waiting for its next attack. use these chances wisely and do not get greedy or deplete your stamina early, as you'll need to be ready to get away at a moment's notice. when it decides to stand up tall, it will try to approach you can slam down its sword vertically at a fairly quick rate, but a well-timed dodge can leave it open to a counter-attack. the watchdog can also, like the others, float into the air, which should tell you to be extremely careful. it will rise into the air as it moves toward you, before slamming into the ground sword first to send out a shockwave. the worst part about this move is that it can do this multiple times, and you'll need to dodge in rapid succession to avoid getting slammed. stay on the defensive until it stops rising back into the air, and let your stamina reset before engaging it again. the unique electric attack it performs is that the watchdog will rear its head backward, and summon sparks of lightning in its mouth. it will then take aim at you and fire a gigantic ball of lightning that, if it hits you, will knock you to the floor. this can be easily dodge-rolled or blocked by one of the pillars in the room, but keep an eye on your timing so you don't avoid it too early or too late. if using ranged or magic attacks, always wait until after its strikes to backpedal and let loose some of your own, or you might be caught mid-animation by its quick sword lunge or downward slams. since it is fairly slow, you can usually keep out of range of its telegraphed attack. upon defeating the erdtree burial watchdog, you'll earn the glovewort picker's bell bearing (1) . /n old altus tunnel is one of the minor dungeons found in the altus plateau region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few treasure items and a miniboss foe. this page contains information on the location, walkthrough, and guide to traverse this dungeon, locate all of its treasure, and tips to defeat the enemies

hill site of grace, making your way into the canyon to the east of wyndham ruins. as the canyon curves around to the left, you'll notice an imp seal locking a pathway into a mining tunnel. after using a stonesword key to unlock the imp seal, progress inside, ride the lift down and you'll find a site of grace. beyond the site of grace, heading down the tunnel you'll emerge in front of a wooden shack, where a stonedigger with a lantern (that can spew fire) and a dog reside. after dealing with them, around the right side of the shack is a smithing stone (5) , as well as some cracked crystal deposits lining the entrance to the next section of cave. in the next room, curve around the wooden platform to the right and climb the ladder. through the tunnel ahead, you'll arrive in a cave with more stonediggers and a leyndell soldier. to the left is a shack with two dogs, and a corpse holding the boltdrake talisman +1 . there are various cracked crystal deposits and a smithing stone (5) tucked behind the barrels up a small slope to the northwest. around the right side of the shack is a corpse holding stanching boluses . backtrack out and then drop off the right side of the platform to land on the wooden platform on the other side of the room to where you entered. at the end of the platform are two stonediggers, a smithing stone (5) deposit and a corpse that holds a golden rune (6) . halfway back across this platform is a ladder descending down to the bottom floor. at the bottom, you'll face a leyndell soldier and two leyndell knights. in the southern shack, there are also two dogs but they are unlikely to aggro until you climb the steps. in that shack with the dogs is the troll's hammer on a corpse. in the northern shack, a corpse holds a somber smithing stone (4) . you have a couple of paths to take here; a tunnel to the west or a tunnel tucked behind the northern shack. heading through the tunnel behind the northern shack, you'll enter the room where a dog and a stonedigger will charge out at you from either side of the room, and a smithing stone (5) and somber smithing stone (5) line the back wall. backtracking out and taking the other tunnel west, as soon as you turn the left corner you'll be greeted with a mist wall. the stonedigger troll is identical to others you will encounter throughout the lands between, including the dungeon boss you'll encounter in limgrave tunnels . the troll will often begin the fight by sprinting over to slam down with a foot, before immediately following up with a huge sweeping swing, which you'll need to dodge behind and attack its back. the stomp can actually be blocked, but you'll want to avoid the sweep that follows at all costs. the troll can also try a backhanded sweep as its reorients to face you, but with less range than the club, you can backpedal to avoid it. however, if you see the troll turn to find you attacking its back and you see it raise its club, roll forward or you'll be caught in a quick downward slam. many times, the stonedigger troll will try to follow up the stomp and sweep with a rushing sweep attack - but if you make sure it's facing one of the walls of the arena during the first sweep, it will run forward and hit the wall, causing it to stagger backward and give you several free hits. as long as you don't get too greedy with these attacks, you can quickly prepare to avoid its follow-up slam when it turns around. if you also prioritize your attacks via lock-on to just one of its legs, after it rams into a wall you can actually bring it to the floor, dealing a heavy amount of damage to the troll, and further allowing you to get free hits in. sometimes this strategy (if executed well) can end the fight in under a minute. one of its more powerful attacks you'll need to watch out for is when it begins to slowly lift its club up with two hands over its head and roars. it will slam down with an explosive force that sends a huge shockwave, meaning you'll want to be far away from its radius. it can also roar as it brings the club up over the side of its head, which means its preparing to launch into a string of overhead slam attacks as it moves forward toward you - and given the size of the arena, it can quickly close the distance, so you'll need to quickly dodge roll under its legs to get out of the way, or you'll risk taking massive damage - especially from its final huge shockwave slam. upon defeating the stonedigger troll, you'll earn the great club weapon. /n the shaded castle is one of the minor dungeons found in the altus plateau

head south to find a seated corpse holding neutralizing boluses . then heading north you'll find multiple zombies, and a sloping roof to the right with 4 additional zombies, with some miranda sprouts and a large miranda flower on the ground level, producing scarlet rot vapor clouds. they guard a corpse with a smithing stone (5) . return to the courtyard and now finally climb the ladder. at the top, you can head to the northwest or to the east. to the north, deal with the multiple zombies (including those that will ambush you from the right), then grab the glass shard x2 off the corpse hanging from the ledge. at the end of the pathway is a cleanrot knight defending a room with a chest. after clearing the knight, the chest contains the valkyrie's prosthesis . backtrack along the ramparts and head to the east are 3 zombies sitting down, and you can jump over the east side onto a wooden platform with a large zombie looking up to the corpse above. you can then drop down to the north and face off against the hooded enemies again, as well as one on horseback. heading to the east in this section, you'll see a poisonbloom plant, a corpse within the wooden structure holding a smithing stone (4) , and a ladder to the southeast. up the ladder, head right and defeat the perfumer to grab the perfume bottle off of the corpse hanging off the ledge you saw earlier. backtrack and head down the other end of the rampart to fight two perfumers and grab the smithing stone (5) off of the corpse in the corner. now go back down the ladder and head to the western section, where a corpse is up against a tombstone holding a golden rune (6) . passing up the steps to the north, you'll see another enemy on horseback and a royal revenant will rise from the ground. defeating both,

the northwest corner of the roof. go back down the ladder then head through the doorway to the east and kill the dog on the right eating a corpse that holds hefty beast bone x4 . then cross over the walkway on the left to face another cleanrot knight. in the room across the bridge, there is an undead soldier, a page, and a corpse containing gold firefly x2 . out the door on the upper level of the room are two dogs and another cleanrot knight. in the northwest corner is a corpse holding a smithing stone (5) . in the southwest corner, you can kick down a ladder to open a shortcut. now head into the circular room where the cleanrot knight came from to ride a lift up to a corridor leading to a mist wall. elemer of the briar is a humanoid enemy wielding a large sword. it imbues the sword with red magical energy that allows the sword to swing around elemer independently. the majority of the attacks are swipes, lunges, and sweeps with the blade that can either be dodge-rolled through or parried depending on your confidence with either. elemer can move fast around the arena so ranged combat will prove difficult unless you summon a spirit ash that can potentially draw some aggro from elemer off of you. the main attacks to be aware of are these magically imbued attacks, signaled by a red glow to elemer's blade or hands. when the blade floats, it can cover the entire width of the arena so dodging is your only true course of action. elemer will occasionally begin outstretching their hand as it begins to pulse with a red light, and this is telegraphing a grab attack where, if it connects with you, elemer will raise you into the air and slam you back into the ground with the sword. one final move to be cautious of is a shoulder barge that has more range than you might think. it's telegraphed very little, but is often utilized when there is a small amount of distance between you and elemer (which only tends to occur if you're using an aggressive spirit ash). if it connects it will send you flying backward onto the floor, but elemer rarely initiates a follow-up attack before you have the chance to recover. upon defeating elemer of the briar, you'll earn the marais executioner's sword and the briar greatshield . /n gelmir hero's grave is one of the minor dungeons found in the mt. gelmir region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few treasure items and a miniboss foe. this page contains information on the location, walkthrough, and guide to traverse this dungeon, locate all of its treasure, and tips to defeat the enemies within.

loop around the side of the cliff and head south just west of the first mt. gelmir campsite site of grace, or head north from hermit village, and from the primeval sorcerer azur site of grace, ramp off of the large stone column and drop down to reach the domed building housing this dungeon. heading inside, ride the lift down, and proceed into the room ahead to find a site of grace. beyond the site of grace, head down the stairs to the left and as you reach the bottom of the second flight, there will be a large sloping pathway lined with running lava. this is a similar setup to fringefolk hero's grave , where a giant mechanical chariot runs along the center track, up and down, creating an insta-kill hazard for you to contend with. as you begin running down, the chariot at the very bottom will begin riding up. the first two alcoves hold skeletons, and you'll need to duck into one of the alcoves to avoid the chariot. the next set of alcoves, which you can run to as the chariot rides above you, holds a skeleton archer on the right along with a grave violet . the third alcove holds a skeleton on the left, and the fourth is an alcove on the right with another skeleton. the final sprint you'll want to make is down the last bit of track, then performing a running jump across the lava to the debris-filled path on the left. grab the grave glovewort (7) plant as soon as you jump across, then head into the room up the steps. you'll be immediately ambushed by a page, with another further down the corridor to the south. there are also a number of undead soldiers scavenging on the ground on either side of the room, but can be easily dealt with. grab the two grave glovewort plants immediately to the left and right, then head to the sheltered portion of the room (to the right of the stairs), defeat the two undead soldiers scavenging there, and grab the other two grave glovewort plants. heading up the stairs, there is another undead soldier and page staring at the corridor rhythmically spewing fire. you can sneak up to the swordsman and get a backstab in, often knocking them into the flames and defeating them instantly. on the opposite side of the room, you'll see a ghost glovewort (7) plant. timing it to avoid the fire, sprint through the corridor and strike the column producing the fire to lower it and stop the hazard. you can then either head into a room to the east, or to the south. in the room to the south, there is an undead soldier to the immediate right, and tucked in the furthest back alcoves are two pages. they guard a corpse against the back wall that holds a golden rune (6) . heading through the passageway to the south, you'll be on another track for a chariot, so be careful before stepping out. if you time it and run up the slope to the right, you'll find a corpse holding a stonesword key . though this is a dead-end, you can stay in the corner of the dead-end to avoid getting hit by the chariot as it reaches you and turns around. this will likely kill you as you try to run back down (as the chariot won't go down the track far enough for you to sprint back down to an alcove), so weigh up your options. heading down the slope, there is a skeleton warrior in the alcove to the left, and a skeleton archer in the right alcove. the next section can prove difficult, as you will need to run to the section of the track with the drop-off either side, then drop down into the chasm, hugging the track wall, to land on a narrow ledge lower down. a corpse is on the eastern side holding a smoldering butterfly . head through the small tunnel in the center of this lower platform, and grab the grave violet in front of you. round the back of the column is a bloodhound knight, who upon defeating it will give you the bloodhound knight helm , bloodhound knight armor , bloodhound knight gauntlets , and bloodhound knight greaves . the corpse that the knight was resting in front of will give you another full set of armor; the gelmir knight helm , gelmir knight armor , gelmir knight gauntlets , and gelmir knight greaves . turning around 180-degrees, you'll see a ladder to climb. at the top, a corpse is hidden amongst the pots on the right that holds root resin x5 . carefully crouch out of the arched window openings and step onto the wooden beams. below you will be another chariot track. wait for the chariot to pass, then drop down and collect the grave violet , and in the alcove to the east, there is a cemetery shade who will drop the mantis blade . at this point, you'll be just beyond the chasm where you previously dropped down. backtrack to the first slope, and upon reaching the point where you jumped to the left onto the debris with the fire trap room beyond, counter to logic, begin non-stop rolling through the lava down the rest of the slope. the chariot won't follow you, so don't worry about getting hit. turn to the left and you'll enter a room with a grave violet plant and a chest containing the ringed finger weapon. go back out of the room and you'll note an alcove across the lava in the left corner that has a grave glovewort (7) plant. roll over there, collect the plant and you'll be able to drop down a gap along the back wall onto a platform, and then down again to land near a set of double doors. grab the grave glovewort (7) plant on the western wall, then head east, and at the bottom of a small ladder is a corpse that holds beast blood x3 . head back up the ladder and open the doors to a larger room with a set of stairs leading down towards the boss fight. a large red wolf, this boss has a near-identical moveset to the red wolf of radagon . the red wolf of the champion is both quick and powerful, and continually switches up its attacks by using both ranged and close-quarters combat. his biting and swipe attacks are quick and usually part of multi-hit combos, so play conservatively before launching into an attack as the wolf can very easily catch you out mid-animation. the wolf can summon a magic fiery sword that it swings with its mouth. thankfully these attacks are much easier to see coming and easier to punish than his basic attacks. block the swings or dodge towards the wolf as it slashes and you should be able to hit back or guard counter. any time the wolf retreats, it will summon homing missiles (which can either be individual or in groups of three) which hang in the air for a moment before flying toward you. these can be easily dodge-rolled, though keep an eye on the wolf as it will often close the distance again and begin attacking before all of the missiles are gone. upon defeating the red wolf of the champion, you'll earn the bloodhound knight floh ashes , and there is a chest at the back of the arena that holds a deathroot . /n volcano cave is one of the minor dungeons found in the mt. gelmir region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few treasure items and a miniboss foe. this page contains information on the location, walkthrough, and guide to traverse this dungeon, locate all of its treasure, and tips to defeat the enemies within. enemies boss notable loot demi-humans demi-human queen margot coil shield , arteria leaf , jar cannon in the northernmost section of mt. gelmir, you will want to head north from the ninth mt. gelmir campsite site of grace, across the bridge to the northeast, then follow the curve of the mountain, facing some leyndell soldiers and demi-humans upon approach. upon reaching the dead end, on the left buried in the cliff face is the entrance to the cave. upon heading inside through a small tunnel you'll arrive at a site of grace. just beyond the site of grace, you'll see some cave moss off to the left of an opening where there are a number of demi-humans crouching down. clearing out the five demi-humans, you'll have three paths to choose from; a tunnel in the northwest corner, a tunnel to the west (though this only leads to an overlook), and a tunnel to the south. through the tunnel to the northwest, you'll emerge on a ledge with a corpse containing a golden rune (6) . drop down off the ledge to reach the area one floor lower, grab the crystal cave moss clumps on the floor, then head down the slope to the north, deal with the demi-human halfway down, then emerge into a cave filled with boxes. there are four demi-humans in here, two of the larger variety wielding clubs. there are two corpses; one in the center of the room that holds arteria leaf x3 , and two to the southwest that holds the coil shield and sliver of meat x6 respectively. backtrack to the initial cave and head down the tunnel to the south, through a long sloping tunnel where you'll encounter a demi-human chief that will summon some extra demi-humans from the ledge above. after grabbing the cave moss and budding cave moss on the ground, loot the corpse to the west to grab lump of flesh x5 . to the northeast through a small tunnel is a mist wall. a gigantic variant of a demi-human, queen margot is identical to demi-human queen maggie , who you will have encountered on your approach to volcano manor. margot wields a large staff capable of spellcasting, but also can be used by margot as a melee weapon. margot will often open the fight by casting a glintstone crystal spell, sending a homing missile in your direction. as you approach, margot can perform lunging stabs with the staff that emit a small shockwave upon impact, but as long as you remain constantly on the move and strafe where necessary this attack is unlikely to hit you. margot will, particularly if you remain close-quarters, throw the staff at you, discarding it completely. this will transition margot into more of a brute animalistic fighter. the majority of the moves are reminiscent of a runebear's moveset, consisting of body slams and jumping lunges. there can also be ground pounds directly in front of margot but these can be easily dodge-rolled through, even with the shockwave that they emit. bites can also occur, but if you utilize a weapon with at least +9 and/or upgraded spirit ashes (which can draw margot's melee attacks away from you), this fight should end very quickly. upon defeating demi-human queen margot, you'll earn the jar cannon . /n seethewater cave is one of the minor dungeons found in the mt. gelmir region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few treasure items and a miniboss foe. this page contains information on the location, walkthrough, and guide to traverse this dungeon, locate all of its

on the map, tucked into the rocks on a raised section of rock with a torch-wielding soldier, you'll note an imp seal. using a stonesword key to open the imp seal, head down the long winding tunnel beyond to reach a site of grace. beyond the site of grace, drop down off the ledge, grab the cave moss and proceed through the opening to the left and face a leyndell soldier. the path will fork where to the right is another leyndell soldier around a campfire, with a budding cave moss plant on the northern wall. heading from the fork in the path northwest, you'll find a couple of crystal cave moss patches. drop down onto the ledge below, then land in a river of poison. grab the two poisonbloom plants behind you, then sprint into the cavern ahead and reach the patch of land in the center to avoid your poison meter maxing out. poisonous skeletal slimes will drop from the ceiling throughout the room, so ensure you don't get caught out as they will absorb you into them if they land on you. in the northeast corner of the room is a corpse holding poison grease x3 . to the southwest, the cavern continues with multiple fungal soldiers roaming the waters. just before proceeding, head up a slope to find multiple cave moss patches, and a dead end with a corpse holding lump of flesh x4 , defended by two small rats and one giant rat. now heading deeper into the caverns, loop around the left-hand side of the ridge with the fungal soldier above to find an alcove with a corpse holding preserving boluses . now head onwards and defeat the fungal soldiers on this level, then drop off of the ledge in the next room to find two pathways. going through the tunnel to the southwest, an upwards-sloping pathway holds three small rats, and at the top, you'll emerge on the upper level of the previous main cavern. after defeating the three fungal soldiers up there, a corpse can be found on the left with a golden rune (7) . around the corner to the southeast is a tunnel leading to a room with praying fungal soldiers in front of a miranda flower. the miranda flower is guarding two corpses; one holds immunizing white cured meat , and the other holds the mushroom armor set - the mushroom head , mushroom body , mushroom arms , and mushroom legs . backtracking down the slope with the rats, out to the room with the waterfall, and take the alternate tunnel to the north, where there will be a giant hole in the ground. carefully dropping from platform to platform down the hole, defeating the two small rats guarding a corpse with poisonbone dart x10 halfway down, you'll reach the bottom. you can now either head up and to the west, or down and to the east. heading up, you'll reach a dead end with a small rat, and a corpse holding a golden rune (6) . now heading down east, you'll arrive in a small space with the mist wall to the right. kindred of rot will be a familiar enemy if you have thoroughly explored certain areas of the map, mainly the lake of rot and sellia crystal tunnel. insectoid enemies that are agile and wield spears. there are two kindred of rot in this fight, which can lead you to be easily and swiftly overwhelmed and to expedite your issues the outskirts of the arena have poisonous waters, meaning you ideally want to stick to the center of the arena, immediately limiting your safe range of movement against these relentless enemies. performing sweeps and lunges with their spears, and dashes around the arena which also result in a delayed swipe, they are competent melee fighters with physical attacks that are enough to quickly kill you if you mistime your blocks, parries, or dodges. arguably, the most infuriating and painful move they perform is a flurry of projectiles that it ejects from either side of itself, that rapidly beeline towards you. each projectile can damage you, regardless of how many have or haven't hit you. you'll want to dodge-roll at the last possible second, just as the projectiles are about to reach you, to clear them successfully. it's highly recommended to draw some heat off of yourself by summoning a spirit ash as soon as you enter the fight, preferably something that can both deal and take damage, something like a leveled-up mimic tear ash. upon defeating the kindred of rot, you'll earn the kindred of rot's exultation . /n elden ring features a large variety of different types of

approach the large bridge, loop around the right-hand side just before the bridge to see a path sloping down to some double doors buried in the rock face. through the doors, around the corner to the right, you'll find a site of grace. beyond the site of grace, down the two flights of stairs, you'll enter a room lined with statues of erdtree burial watchdogs. a fanged imp with a two-handed sword will drop from the ceiling across the room. the small room to the west has two more fanged imps; one directly ahead in view, and one waiting to ambush you from the right as soon as you enter. there is a grave glovewort (7) against the back wall. in the previous room, to the north, head down the next flight of stairs is another room with two fanged imps, one on the opposite end and one that will drop from the ceiling in the center of the room. as you turn the corner at the end of the corridor you'll arrive at a lift. before riding it down, grab the grave violet tucked in the left-hand corner. at the bottom of the lift, you'll see the locked doors ahead. pass down the stairs to the left and defeat the fanged imp patrolling the corridor, as well as two additional fanged imps in the central alcoves of the next room who will bombard you with blue flame bombs. ahead is another lift to ride down. at the bottom of this lift, you'll see a statue at the far end of the corridor, but in the room in front of you are two small living jars. dealing with those and continuing towards the statue, a giant living jar will ambush you as you enter the main room. around the outskirts of the room are three small living jars, and a grave violet can be found to the left of the statue. along the west wall of the room is a staircase leading up. in the corridor up there, a pressure plate is in the center of the walkway, so skirt around it and pass up the steps to the left to find a room with three dropping blades and flaming living jars. these flaming jars will charge you and explode, so be careful and try to bait them out into jumping and exploding as you dodge/run away, all the while avoiding the dropping blades. past that room, there is a fork in the path. to the south is a small room with one small living jar, and nothing else. to the east, up the stairs are a number of land squirts, which will also explode after being attacked. carefully clearing them out, avoiding their poisonous clouds, head up the stairs around the corner and eliminate the two small living jars. avoid the pressure plate on the floor (for now) and head towards the room to the north. a giant living jar will be in this room, and can be easily defeated by luring it out and triggering the pressure plate, causing the projectiles to eliminate it after a couple of triggers. at the back of this room is a ritual pot . in the room with this pressure plate, in the middle alcove on the left side of the room is a corpse holding stimulating boluses . there is also a small archway where you can drop down and grab the nascent butterfly off the corpse on the left. drop down and deal with the 3 flaming living jars, then choose from two paths. a path to the north leading to a lift, or a path to the west leading up some stairs. up the lift, you'll pass through another room with three fanged imps; two in the various alcoves, and one on the ceiling at the back of the room that won't drop down till after you head up the stairs and defeat the erdtree burial watchdog in the small room. it is guarding a grave glovewort (9) and a corpse holding root resin x4 . backtrack down the lift, and then trigger it to rise again but step off of it. you'll note beneath the lift is a drop in front of a giant living jar. be careful dropping down as the jar's spin attack can easily knock you into the various chasms in this room, so try to immediately lure it into the corridor to the south. through that corridor, around the other side of this upper platform, is the lever, alongside a couple of small living jars to deal with and ensure you grab the golden rune (10) off of the dangling corpse before dropping down and backtracking to the boss doors. an enemy you will be overtly familiar with at this stage in the game, the ulcerated tree spirit is identical to other versions you have faced in the past, both in other dungeons and in the open world. this tree spirit, like the others, is a highly aggressive, incredibly fast-moving enemy and due to its size, it can be very easy to have the game's camera turn on you, particularly if lock-on is used. the tree spirit often has long wind-ups to its attacks but executes them very quickly so can take you by surprise. an example would be the chain of lunging bites that it performs, where it retreats to the opposite side of the arena, and will swing its mouth left and right 3 times, each time requiring a well-placed dodge. as a rule of thumb, you'll want to try and stick to the sides of the boss, rather than the back, as this is the most effective place to dodge-roll out of many of its attacks, including 180-degree spins with its tail. the spirit can also perform a number of fire attacks, be it breathing fire in front of itself as it moves in a line across the arena, or a grab attack where it rears back and quickly lunges forward to grab you with its mouth, subsequently breathing fire on you as you're there, before slamming you to the ground. a major fire-based attack to be extremely cautious of is when the spirit begins to emanate flames all over its body in a yellow aura before exploding out in a large sphere. if you see the spirit begin this animation, sprint or dodge-roll as far away as possible to avoid being blown off your feet and taking extensive damage. swipes with its arms are often followed up immediately with tail swings, so be ready for quick follow-up attacks throughout this encounter. as you're sticking to the sides of the boss, the main attack to watch out for is stomps it performs with its arms. upon defeating this ulcerated tree spirit, you'll earn a golden seed and the glovewort picker's bell bearing (2) . there will also be a chest in this arena that contains a deathroot . /n castle sol is one of the minor

whilst missing a castle in the mountaintops of the giants can be pretty difficult due to the linear nature of the area, castle sol is still a little off the beaten track. north of ancient snow valley ruins site of grace, after crossing the bridge northwest of stargazers' ruins, head as far north as possible and drop down onto the lower slope to find the castle tucked away to the northeast. to the right of the steps at the entrance to the castle is a site of grace. heading in through the entrance, you'll be faced with two large lion guardians. you can make the fight against them easier by backtracking out of the entrance of the castle where they won't follow, and performing well-timed heavy jump attacks or ranged attacks (if available). in a corner to the southeast of the courtyard is a corpse against a tombstone holding a golden rune (10) . beneath the wooden platform to the northeast is a corpse holding a smithing stone (5) . at the top of the two flights of wooden stairs, you'll see two patrolling wolves ahead of you, whilst a bladed talon eagle will descend from the rooftop above you to spring an ambush. wrapping around the west side of this building, there is a corpse hanging off the edge of the platform that holds freezing grease x4 . there is a corpse near the wolves that holds thawfrost boluses x4 . now head through the doorway to the north with the lit brazier and up the wooden steps in the room beyond to face off against spectral castle guards, and a spectral banished knight. on the left-hand side where the spectral crossbowman is, you'll find a corpse holding more thawfrost boluses . you'll note if you look back from where you came there is a staircase on the right side of the building you came from. if you head up there, a corpse is in the northeast corner, holding a golden rune (10) , defended by a couple of spectral caste guards. heading back to where the crossbowman was and now entering the building, you'll note a site of grace in the room to the left, and in a room full of church pues you'll find a praying spirit (non-hostile) and a corpse holding the eclipse shotel . across the courtyard through the door on the left is a room with three crawling albinaurics. up the first flight of stairs is a hanging albinauric which will scream and summon three large spectral castle guards with axes. jump attack the albinauric to cause it to drop and you can kill it. there is a corpse hanging off the side of the upper platform holding a smithing stone (6) . up the next flight of stairs is another hanging albinauric, which will bring two spectral banished knights; one with two swords, the other with a sword and shield. in both cases, if you eliminate the albinaurics without them screaming, the spectres won't be summoned. out of the door at the top of the stairs you'll note a mist wall up the steps to the right, and a lever for a lift on the left. ride the lift down and a corpse will be in the middle of the walkway with a furlcalling finger remedy . enter the room slightly down the path on the right to fight 5 slugs guarding a corpse holding a nascent butterfly . climb up the ladder to the left of the corpse, grab the fan daggers off the corpse on the ledge to the southeast, and walk along the ramparts to find a corpse holding a golden rune (10) . be careful though, you'll be bombed by a spectral castle guard high up to the east, and a castle guard will be mounted on a ballista further down the rampart to the south. dodge-roll at the right times to avoid the ballista shots, which will also explode shortly after landing, then cross the wooden bridge heading east whilst avoiding a second ballista. heading up the steps to the second ballista, there is a corpse in the eastern corner with a smithing stone (6) . descend the ladder next to you to find the "sorcerer" painting , as well as unlocking a door to create a shortcut route. head back up the ladder and jump off to the northeast and land where the bladed talon eagle nested to find a corpse holding the stormhawk axe . head back to the church of the eclipse site of grace within the castle, and instead of heading through the door across the way, loop around to the right and climb the ladder. continuing across the ramparts, you'll note a roof you can jump down to on the left with a ladder. jumping there and heading down the ladder, you'll be in a room for 5 small rats. there is a corpse in the northern corner containing a smithing stone (7) . stepping outside, loop around to the right to find a corpse near a brazier that holds a rune arc . now go back to the lift, and as you ride it up/down, roll off halfway. there is a corpse to your immediate right holding a golden rune (9) , and all the way to the left is a corpse with a smithing stone (6) . now returning to the far right side, you'll see two direwolves and a banished knight with a spear across a small wooden bridge. try a ranged attack to lure them across the bridge and maybe get one or two of them to drop, or at the very least funnel them so they can't easily surround you. beyond these enemies, up the steps to the right is a corpse with a stonesword key . return now to the mist wall, either via the lift or through the room with the albinaurics, and prepare for a boss fight. this can be an incredibly punishing fight if you enter unprepared. from the get-go, you'll want to have a strengthened spirit ash to summon - the mimic tear ash seemed most effective. it is also recommended to have a strike weapon equipped with high stagger capabilities, preferably of at least +10. upon entering the arena, niall will summon two spectral banished knights; one with a sword and shield, the other with two swords. you will want to reciprocate the summoning and bring out your spirit ash immediately. though you might feel inclined to rush niall, it's far more important to focus on the knights first. the knight with the two swords is the most aggressive, so aim for as many heavy jump attacks as possible to stagger them and open them up for a critical strike. you have to get lucky to a certain extent not to get swarmed by niall and the other knight, but it should only take a couple of tries maximum - hopefully your spirit ash will be positioned well enough to draw some attention away from you, or assist you in taking down the knight faster. it is essentially the same strategy for the knight with the shield; in a battle of attrition, keep yourself away from niall and perform heavy attacks to stagger the knight, performing critical strikes when available. with both the knights down, you only have the one target for the rest of the fight. the bad news? niall powers up and becomes incredibly aggressive once the knights go down. niall, like other enemies in castle sol, can inflict frostbite, with attacks like a 360-degree spin over niall's head with his spear. this whips up a whirlwind of frostbite in a large radius around niall. these can be dodged through if you time it correctly between the gusts of wind, but obviously it's safer to retreat backwards as he begins spinning up. this whirlwind can also be used to dash across the arena to you, ending the move in a lunge or swipe with his staff. he will also occasionally imbue his foot prosthetic with electrical energy, which after a short delay, he will slam into the ground by homing in on your position, creating a small electrical shockwave. this electricity can also be transferred into niall's staff, where he will jab at you (or your mimic/spirit ash) with either end of its staff. as a good rule of thumb, if you keep rolling in close proximity to niall, many of his attacks; be them dashes, swipes, lunges or slams, will overshoot you and you'll be safe. upon defeating commander niall, you'll earn the veteran's prosthesis . up the steps beyond the boss arena, you'll find a spirit overlooking the view alongside the haligtree secret medallion (left) . /n cave of the forlorn is

misbegotten crusader hero's rune (2) , rune arc , golden order greatsword , spiritflame arrow , thawfrost boluses in the consecrated snowfield, head to beneath the erdtree on the map and head east along the frozen river, and on the left side of the rock face, you'll see a giant land octopus. behind it is an imp seal that requires a stonesword key. upon breaking the imp seal, head through the tunnel to find a site of grace to the left of a dragon corpse. heading into the cave from the site of grace, a corpse is next to the dragon corpse holding a golden rune (7) . you'll then have two choices; a path to the north, or a path to the east. grab the freezing grease x4 off the corpse to the right, and deal with the sleeping misbegotten. through the small passage to the north is a room with three small rats and two misbegotten; one with wings and one larger variant with an axe. clearing the room, head to the back end of the room and turn around to see a small alcove to the southeast with a corpse holding freezing grease . now backtrack and take the other path to the east, and hugging the left-hand side you'll see a sleeping larger misbegotten, a winged misbegotten and a corpse beyond that holds a nascent butterfly . across the room to the south is a corpse with a golden rune (10) . continuing east, you'll see a large ice pillar with a corpse on the top. you can jump up using the debris on the right side of the room to grab a hero's rune (2) from the corpse. you can now either head west or up the slope to the north. up the slope to the north, you'll find a large sleeping misbegotten, and further down the sloping tunnel, you'll arrive in a cave with two large misbegotten and a winged misbegotten. tucked in the north corner of the room are two corpses; one holds spiritflame arrow x10 , and the other has a rune arc . heading west from the previous room (with the hero's rune corpse), travel around the back of the pillar to be able to platform up it and then jump across the gap to drop down a set of icy platforms onto the ground below. ahead you'll enter a cavern with multiple jellyfish, at the top of which the jellyfish cluster is defending three corpses; one holds thawfrost boluses x2 , one holds miquella's lily x3 , and the third holds crystal dart x8 . around the corner to the northwest will be three more jellyfish, a corpse holding thawfrost boluses x3 , and a hole where you will need to drop from platform to platform. landing on one of the lowest platforms, a corpse hangs off the edge that holds freezing grease x4 . drop down one final time to reach a mist wall. the misbegotten warrior is identical to the leonine misbegotten from castle morne , and the other misbegotten warrior from redmane castle . capable of closing short distances very quickly, efficient and conservative use of your stamina bar will be key to your success. one of its main attacks is a four-move combo, involving three swings back and forth with its sword, finishing with an overhead vertical slam. again, with the speed of this opponent, it will be very difficult to keep any kind of distance between the two of you, so dodge-rolling through the swings and away from the slam are essential. if you're confident in parrying, you can interrupt any of the swings bar the final slam so attempt to get a critical strike there if you think you can execute the timing. it can also get on all fours and launch towards you with a swing, then a 360-degree spin into a launch into the air and stabbing its sword into the ground. the stab with the sword has a lock-on that is best countered by staying underneath the beast as it's in the air and rolling at the last second; your i-frames will help with the resulting shockwave. the beast can swipe with its left hand back and forth, then jump into the air, grab both ends of its sword and slam it down creating a larger shockwave, which is easy to avoid by rolling backward as the sword hits the ground. also be aware that the beast can roar, which will damage you slightly and can even stagger you if your build isn't dexterous enough. with dashing swipes at longer distances, the beast is best faced aggressively. a brutal move to watch out for at close range is a foot stomp, that immediately leads into two 360-degree spins with the sword. this above any other attack in this fight has the highest chance of killing you outright, as if you get caught during the first spin you will be hit by the second. you can block the foot stomp with minor impact on your stamina, but be prepared to immediately execute two dodge-rolls to evade the swings. upon defeating the misbegotten crusader, you'll earn the golden order greatsword . /n consecrated snowfield catacombs is one of the minor dungeons found in the mountaintops of the giants region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few treasure items and a miniboss foe. this page contains information on the location, walkthrough, and guide to traverse this dungeon, locate all of its treasure, and tips to defeat the enemies within. enemies boss notable loot fanged imps/cleanrot knights/burial watchdogs putrid grave warden duelist imp head (elder) , rotten gravekeeper cloak , great grave glovewort descending the initial slope from the consecrated snowfield site of grace, stick to the right-hand side cliffs, and tucked in an alcove you'll find the double doors for the catacombs. these can be very difficult to spot due to the snowstorm surrounding this area, so keep searching up against the rocks till you find it. once the doors are open, head up the first flight of stairs to find a site of grace. beyond the site of grace, head up the next flight of steps to enter a staircase room where a fanged imp will drop from the ceiling at the top of the first flight to ambush you. at the top of the second flight, you'll note a trap at the far end of the corridor spewing frostbite. between bursts, dodge into the alcove on the right, then as you head to the alcove ahead on the left, begin rolling as a fanged imp will leap out to ambush you and can stagger you, leaving you open to being hit by the frostbite cloud. you can then run to the trap and strike it to lower it down. in the alcove where the fanged imp sprung from, you can continue down that path to find the locked boss doors. to the south of the doors, head up the stairs and arrive in a larger room with multiple frostbite traps. to your right will be a fanged imp, and a burial watchdog will descend from the upper floors. a corpse to the left holds root resin x4 , with a grave violet plant behind it. you can now either head through a passageway to the east, or the west. to the east, there is a grave glovewort (8) in the corridor, and you'll then open out into a room with 4 fanged imps that will drop from the ceiling above. you can lure them out into the previous room and line them up to be hit by the frostbite trap if you wish. in that room, there is a grave glovewort (9) plant. backtracking out and heading through the west corridor, a fanged imp with a two-handed sword will ambush you as you exit out into the room beyond, where there is also another fanged imp on the level above. behind that fanged imp one level up, there is a room with another burial watchdog. the room it's defending has two corpses; one with a human bone shard x8 , the other holds the imp head (elder) . there is also a grave glovewort (9) and a grave violet plant in the room. going into the previous room, head into the sheltered portion, and around the corner, to the left, you'll see a narrow tunnel leading out to a non-boss encounter against a cleanrot knight. before proceeding up the stairs to the left after taking out the knight, grab the grave glovewort (8) plant on the right. be careful as you approach the top of the stairs, the multi-tiered frostbite trap will be spewing and a fanged imp will ambush you from the right-hand side. strike the trap when it is safe to do so to prevent it from firing on this level. on the end of the left side of this platform is a grave glovewort (9) , and at the end of the short corridor on the left are two cleanrot knights and a ghost glovewort (9) plant. go back and jump on top of the frostbite trap and strike it to raise you up to a higher platform where there is the boss door lever, a grave glovewort (9) plant, and a corpse holding a golden rune (12) . now head north back down the stairs and through the boss doors on the right to arrive at the mist wall. the putrid grave warden duelist is a humanoid enemy similar to the frenzied duelist of gaol cave , but this duelist is imbued with scarlet rot, inflicting the status effect with all of its attacks. the duelist wields a large two-handed axe and a ball and chain. the duelist often relies on a three-move combo, consisting of a 180-degree swing with the axe, then spinning into a 360-degree swing, ending with a foot stomp with a long wind-up animation. the axe swings can be dodged or parried, and the foot stomp is telegraphed enough to avoid, and though it has a slight lock on, the reach doesn't extend too far if you begin gaining distance. the duelist can also spin twice with diagonal axe swings; the first swing has a long wind-up and therefore can lead you to dodge too early and get caught out, and the second swing ends with the axe slamming into the ground with slightly further reach than the first swing, and can send you flying if you get hit. the duelist also swings the ball and chain around its head in a wide aoe sweep; it has a couple of wind-up swings before the final swipe, which is the one that you're gonna want to dodge through. when the duelist pulls its right arm back, it is about to initiate a grab attack. if it connects, they will lift you into the air, hold you there for a few seconds then throw you across the arena. unlike other grab attacks in the game, whilst this attack does still deal decent damage, it often won't be a death-dealing blow to you. you can dodge back or to the right to avoid it, and can present an opportunity to quickly get behind it and perform a critical strike backstab. at around 50% health, the duelist can perform a battle cry that strengthens its attacks, and the attacks available to them change slightly. it can perform an overhead vertical slam with the axe, a charge where it primes the axe up and behind itself which culminates in the two 360-degree spins as it finishes the charge. another attack is a running drag along the floor, where it drags the axe and upon reaching you swipes the axe up, staggering you if it connects, and finishing in an overhead slam. these charging combos in particular can prove fatal if not countered, so be on the lookout should it begin running at you. upon defeating the putrid grave warden duelist, you'll earn the rotten gravekeeper cloak and two great grave glovewort . /n yelough anix tunnel is one of the minor dungeons found in the mountaintops of the giants region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few treasure items and a miniboss foe. this page contains information on the location, walkthrough, and guide to traverse this dungeon, locate all of its treasure, and tips to defeat the enemies within. enemies boss notable loot stonediggers astel, stars of darkness rune arc , alabaster lord's sword , ancient dragon smithing stone , hero's rune , meteorite of astel in the western section of the consecrated snowfield, you'll find the yelough anix ruins and to the south of the ruins' symbol on the map, along the western ridge of the cliff, you'll see a slope heading downwards northbound. tucked into the cliff face is the entrance to the tunnel. once inside, ride the lift down to find a site of grace. beyond the site of grace, head down the tunnel until you see a wooden door to the north. the door is locked, so to the southwest of the corpse on the floor in this section of the tunnel is a large hole in the ice. drop down to the platform below, then down again to face off against two stonediggers. a corpse is in the center of this room that holds freezing grease x3 . proceed down the tunnel to the south and emerge in another ice cave, where a stonedigger will ambush you from the right. after defeating it, head to the far end of the room and kill the stonedigger on the right, then jump across the gap and kill the stonedigger throwing rocks. you can grab a golden rune (10) off of a corpse sitting on the ledge you just jumped across. before continuing into the room to the north on this level, descend the long ladder at the back of the room (by the second stonedigger), and head into the alcove to the northeast to kill two stonediggers guarding a corpse holding a rune arc . moving to the northwest, an alabaster lord will emerge from the small alcove on the left, and upon defeating him you'll get the alabaster lord's sword . against the northern wall is a corpse holding the ancient dragon smithing stone . head back up the ladder and move into the room to the north; kill the stonedigger sitting by the brazier and grab the explosive stone clump x6 off of the corpse sat nearby. up the first wooden ladder is two stonediggers, then up the next is a tunnel leading around to the west where you'll see an alabaster lord across the room. after dealing with it, best disabled with jumping heavy attacks, grab the hero's rune (5) off of the corpse on the floor in the center. there is a small alcove to the north with a somber smithing stone (9) deposit, and in the southeast is a smithing stone (8) deposit. in the next room along, you can open the small wooden door on the ledge to the left (the previously locked one at the beginning of the tunnel) to allow a shortcut, and the large wooden doors to the north of the room lead into a boss fight. a hyper-aggressive malformed star, astel is identical to the astel, naturalborn of the void fight, and will likely take a number of attempts due to the sheer ferocity of its attacks, and the variety of moves it can perform. entering the arena through the mist wall, astel will likely open the fight with a giant beam that it summons between its mandibles. this attack, like many others that astel uses, requires slightly delayed reactions to avoid. for example, this beam is built up as astel rears its head backward, then angles it down to target you, and you'll need to wait a second or so with astel in that state to dodge it as it fires. astel uses its tail like a scorpion, swiping from over its head, performing two slam attacks. astel slightly raises into the air as it prepares for the slams, and like the beam, you'll need to dodge later than you'd expect, once astel has landed again to sync up with the tail coming down. the majority of astels attacks revolve around the use of gravitational energy; summoning purple spheres with cosmic-looking trails to it. these are either in the form of swipes with its hands, leaving a vapour trail behind it that explodes after a short delay. if caught in this vapour trail, you'll have enough time to escape if you roll in the appropriate direction out of the path of the trail. because, particularly if you're a melee character, you'll be spending most of your time underneath astel's abdomen, it has a number of punishing attacks if you get too greedy. these play out as either astel summoning these purple spheres in its hands and slamming them into the ground, sending out pulsing waves of energy that will knock you down should they hit you. you can roll through each of these waves, but that requires pinpoint timing to try not to panic if you're beneath astel and you see it preparing an attack. another is astel creating a gravity well in a circle around itself, which you'll notice by small rocks beginning to float in that vicinity. after a few seconds, everything in that circle will begin levitating before astel slams it back down to the ground. this can be an insta-kill move, so sprint from the radius and begin running back in the second the slam hits the ground. astel also has some mandible attacks that occur if you linger in front of it; one regular two-move bite, and a super-charged variant that is signalled by blue energy lining its mandibles. if caught by this, astel will raise you into the air, and almost always acts as an insta-kill as it slams you back into the floor. if astel hunches over and a sphere begins appearing and pulsing above its body, it is about to teleport away to a different section of the arena. as it does so however, the sphere will explode outwards, so sprint away as it begins to do this. you will also want to keep your head on a swivel for where it spawns, because if you don't immediately see a new sphere signalling astel's arrival, it's about to perform an arena-wide lunge attack from above that, if caught in its mandibles, results in an instant kill. roll at the last moment towards astel if it does this to avoid the move connecting. at around 50% health, astel can rear its head back as cosmic portals appear behind it. as the portals begin pulsing, they will repeatedly fire comets at you, raining down for a few seconds. no amount of range will protect you from these comets targeting you, so you'll need to roll for your life as the comets begin emerging from the portals. upon defeating astel, stars of darkness, you'll earn the meteorite of astel . /n spiritcaller's cave is one of the minor dungeons found in the mountaintops of the giants region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few treasure items and a miniboss foe. this page contains information on the location, walkthrough, and guide to traverse this dungeon, locate all of its treasure, and tips to defeat the enemies within. enemies boss notable loot spirit-caller snail/spectral wolves/inaba, disciple of okina godskin apostle and godskin noble hero's rune (1) , rune arc , arteria leaf , white reed armor , white reed gauntlets , white reed greaves , godskin swaddling cloth , black flame ritual heading southeast from the frozen lake site of grace, keep to the western side and you'll note a cluster of jellyfish. buried in the rock face behind the cluster, you'll see an imp seal entrance to the cave. upon using a stonesword key to break the imp seal, head through the tunnel beyond to find a site of grace. progressing past the site of grace, you'll arrive in a darkened cave with multiple cave moss plants. there is a cracked portion of the floor in the center which, if stepped on, will collapse and land you on a series of platforms below. dropping down, you'll note a spirit-caller snail that summons spectral wolves in the tunnel ahead. after dealing with them, head into the next room down the tunnel and you'll note a spirit-caller snail and inaba, disciple of okina (a hostile spectre) down a level to the left. inaba will likely jump up to face you, so defeat them first. head up the tunnel to the northwest on the higher platform you entered the room on, and in the dark room you emerge into turn into the alcove to the south to find three corpses; one holds a golden rune (10) , one holds a rune arc , and the third holds a hero's rune (1) . there are also multiple crystal cave moss plants in this section of the cave. jumping up the rock and progressing to the east, you'll see a spectral wolf and a spirit-caller snail near a corpse that holds arteria leaf x5 . if you walk up the collapsed log to the northwest, you'll arrive back in the initial room of the cave where the floor collapsed. retracing your steps to where inaba spawned, there are two corpses in that lower section of the room; one holds freezing grease x2 , and the other holds a golden rune (12) . progress south following the glowing water and there are multiple spectral wolves and direwolves, and inaba will respawn here. as a strategy, sprint to the southwest behind a tree with a corpse against it to kill a spirit-caller snail, and then sprint southeast to kill the other snail to eliminate all the wolves in the room and inaba. you can now explore the room leisurely, where you can find three corpses; one holding invigorating white cured meat , one with the white reed armor , white reed gauntlets , and white reed greaves , and then the final corpse holds a golden rune (6) . there is a small tunnel to the south at the far end of this room that leads down towards a mist wall. a multi-stage fight, though thankfully you'll only be facing one opponent at a time. the apostle is first, and will, at range, throw blackflame at you, knocking you to the ground should it make contact. these can be easily dodge-rolled so long as you keep an eye on the apostle at all times, otherwise this will catch you out and leave you vulnerable to a follow-up attack. as a melee fighter, the apostle is incredibly aggressive. the apostle can perform jabs with the lower end of its staff but mainly relies on fast flurries and combos. it spins staff furiously in front of itself, creating a whirlwind-type effect that is recommended that you just run away from. it will also perform multiple 360-degree spins often ending in an overhead jumping slam. all of these attacks are best dodged, as the ferocity of the attacks can make it incredibly risky to attempt a parry. at around 50% health, the apostle will float off the ground and hunch up before exploding out in a blackflame sphere. this initiates the second phase of the encounter, where the apostle becomes even more aggressive and speedy. it also has the ability to extend its body to cross the entire distance of the arena, performing variations of sweeps, slams, and slashes but aren't restricted to the apostle's immediate vicinity. the best way to make this encounter far easier, like other boss fights, is to use the mimic tear ashes. that allows the apostle to focus many of its attacks on the mimic, which makes it easier to execute jumping attacks that can stagger the apostle opening it up to critical strikes. the godskin noble then apparates in the center of the arena, who will perform standard lunges, swipes, and slams. the noble can also expand itself as a deterrent to send you flying backward if you are too close to the noble for too long. it can also, in this expanded state, roll around the arena and will lock on to your position, requiring accurate timing to ensure you can dodge out of the way. it can also create a sphere of blackflame as a persistent aoe, but the noble can often be lured out of this area. upon defeating the noble, a spirit-caller snail will appear in the arena, and you'll want to rush over and quickly kill it to end the encounter asap. upon defeating all three enemies, you'll earn the godskin swaddling cloth and the black flame ritual . /n giant-conquering hero's grave is one of the minor dungeons found in the mountaintops of the giants region in elden ring. it is an optional dungeon that is home to a few treasure items and a miniboss foe. this page contains information on the location, walkthrough, and guide to traverse this dungeon, locate all of its treasure, and tips to defeat the enemies within. enemies boss notable loot fanged imps/fire monks/burial watchdogs/troll

left of the giant's mountaintop catacombs icon on the map in mountaintop of the giants, you'll actually need to travel southwest from giants' gravepost site of grace, along the lower western slope, passing multiple spider hands as you go. jump across a small gap to reach the structure in the distance. after lifting the door, ride the lift down and you'll find a site of grace. beyond the site of grace, you'll see an imp seal in the back right corner of the room. using a stonesword key to open the seal, head down the steps and loot the flame, protect me incantation from the corpse to the left. then return to the site of grace and head down the stairs to the south and face off against a patrolling fire monk. whilst you can head down the steps to the east, first strike the wall in the southwest corner to reveal an illusory wall. in one of the window archways on the left of the corridor beyond, you'll find a golden rune (11). now you can head down the stairs to the east and grab the grave violet plant on the right. as you turn the corner down the last flight of stairs, you'll be in a large room where you can see a burial watchdog in the distance, shrouded in darkness. like sainted hero's grave , you'll need to lure these shadowy enemies into the circle of light on the opposite end of the room to make them vulnerable. as you sprint past the watchdog, shadowy fanged imps will also drop from the walls on both sides. after luring them all into the light and defeating them (likely clearing the fanged imps first), return to the left of the steps you descended entering the room to find a grave glovewort (7) plant. now head down the steps beneath the circle of light platform, where two additional fanged imps will drop from the ceiling which will need to be lured back up to make them vulnerable. at the far end of this lower room is a grave glovewort (9). now head back up to the circle of light and turn left through the corridor to be confronted with a fire trap. if you turn left there is a dead end with a grave violet plant. timing your sprint, run to an alcove on the right halfway down the fire trap corridor to face another fire monk. then sprint to the fire trap and strike it to lower and disable it. heading up the stairs to the south, you'll want to look out for a fire monk who will be patrolling one level above you, so it will likely drop down from above behind you as you emerge out into the room proper. heading up the stairs from where the monk descended, you'll find some freezing grease and another imp seal. opening the imp seal with a stonesword key, you'll see a corpse and a grave glovewort (8) plant in the distance. as you pass the hole in the floor from the fire trap having been lowered, two shadowy fanged imps will drop from the ceiling behind you. to deal with them, you'll need to backtrack and drop down the hole onto the top of the fire trap and strike it, causing it to rise and subsequently allow the light circle on the floor to complete and enabling the defeating of the imps. you'll want to head closer to the corpse on the far end to draw out a third fanged imp wielding a two-handed sword. the corpse holds the cranial vessel candlestand . now head back and continue south to arrive at a lift. riding the lift down, you'll arrive in a room with a destroyed staircase to the right, and a wooden gate with a lever to the left. pulling the lever, the gate will lift and you'll see a shadowy troll in the distance. behind the troll is the locked boss doors. to make the troll vulnerable, step on the lift pressure plate and jump off before it rises. when the lift finishes rising, you'll see a statue casting the circle of light onto the floor in front of the lift. you can then aggro the troll and lure it into the light to be able to kill it. before heading through the boss doors, jump down off either side of the walkway to find a large fire monk. after defeating it, grab the great grave glovewort to the east, then grab the giant's seal to the south. in the southwest corner of the room, head through the corridor and descend the ladder to find two shadowy burial watchdogs, one straight ahead and one around the corner to the right. sprint to the end of that right turn area, behind the stone column in the center to grab a grave glovewort (9). then sprint past the burial watchdog to the west, grab the grave glovewort (8) plant, and then climb the ladder in the alcove on the right. at the top of the ladder, you'll see two grave glovewort (8) plants to the left, and to the right you can drop down from broken stairs and continue on to the boss doors. just to the left of the boss doors is a ghost glovewort (9). an identical fight to the ancient hero you will encounter in the sainted hero's grave , the ancient hero of zamor relies on acrobatic blade attacks, fast jumps and dodges, and frostbite-imbued attacks during the second phase. because of the agility, ranged/magic attacks are mostly ineffective. other than melee attacks, the hero of zamor will summon a blue light in its hand that telegraphs a small spherical explosion around itself that inflicts the frostbite status effect. during the first phase of the fight, you'll want to be particularly aggressive, as the second phase inversely requires heavily defensive play. the ancient hero will kneel and imbue its sword with frostbite when it reaches 50% health, making its attacks more potent across the board in the second phase. a particularly deadly one is a variant of the frostbite burst from the first phase, where the ancient hero will create a huge blizzard in a large radius around itself, from which it will spring out into a lunge attack. again, playing defensively is key here so time your strikes carefully at the end of the ancient hero's combos. because your attacks will be more dispersed, anything that can apply damaging status effects is recommended to help whittle down the hero's health even without you attacking. upon defeating the ancient hero of zamor, you'll earn the zamor curved sword , the zamor mask , the zamor armor , the zamor bracelets , and the zamor legwraps . /n ign has the tips and tricks , strategies, and secrets you need to succeed in elden ring. this page includes tips for beginners, players new to fromsoftware games and veterans alike looking to see what is new. also included are essential tips for combat, and exploring the lands between. see also: things to do first , things elden ring doesn't tell you , and our beginner's guide to gameplay and features beginner tips combat tips exploration tips elden ring features an incredibly large world to explore, you're not going to want to jog everywhere. luckily, you can sprint (either on foot or on horseback) as much as you want when traveling -- and it won't use up any stamina! however, once you enter combat or get close to an enemy, sprinting will start consuming stamina, so be wary where you run! as an open world game, the lands between are yours to explore at your leisure, in the order you choose. if you find a place or boss that looks difficult, you can always find a way to explore in another direction if you look hard enough, and return to previous challenges when you level up in elden ring or get better weapons to help you. in addition to the large sprawling "legacy dungeons" where the demigods of elden ring reside, you'll find all sorts of smaller dungeons in the lands between. all of them are optional and can be explored or bypassed as you wish. dungeons can be as small as a few cave rooms, or as spacious as a fortress with multiple tiers and buildings. each will be home to a miniboss that will often drop a rare or unique item that may make it worth your while, as well as items that can be found along the way. it's even possible to bypass certain legacy dungeons, and find alternate routes to unlock new regions - but be prepared to find tougher enemies. if you're having trouble finding smaller dungeons to explore, be on the lookout for decrepit looking statues holding a small blue flame. interacting with them will summon a faint blue trail leading in the direction of a nearby optional dungeon. you can also find tall ghostly candelabras that summon an ethereal spirit - following his trail can lead you to secrets like dungeons as well. while there is a day and night cycle in elden ring, you'll find that most of the game won't be affected by whether the sun or the moon is out. however, you may find enemy visibility reduced at night, and some areas may host different enemies when the sun goes down - like certain roaming bosses . it can be tempting to race along the open world and bypass enemies you find on your way towards the next big dungeon, but remember that fights you bypass will mean less runes to level up, and less items gained to use when things really get challenging. stop to smell the flowers - so to speak - and kill everyone you meet to keep gaining runes as you explore. sites of grace are plentiful in the lands between, and often times you'll find them on the outskirts of large points of interest or along the main roads. if you don't see any, be on the lookout for the small stake of marika statues that you can choose to respawn at if you die nearby - these are often located next to challenging fights, allowing you to quickly respawn nearby and get back into the fray. crafting is a key mechanic of elden ring that can easily be overlooked. things like fire pots won't be found anywhere else - you'll need to craft them yourself in cracked pots that regenerate when thrown, allowing you to make different variants as needed. since materials are so abundant, don't neglect stockpiling weapon grease, throwing knives, throwable pots, and other consumables that can help in difficult encounters! there's no weight attached to crafting materials, and your storage will hold tons, so there's little reason not to spam the pick up button as you race across flowers and items as you travel. you'll never know when you might need to craft a certain item, so its better to have a surplus of items than to waste time looking for the one material you need. perhaps even more important than just leveling up, the key to progression is often tied to increasing the power of your armaments. you'll find smithing stones all over the lands between - from bodies that litter the landscape, from certain enemies, and especially in mines. don't neglect using them to reinforce your weapons and bring up their level, as having an appropriately scaled weapon can be crucial to getting through tough encounters. you can find a smithing table at the church of elleh at the start of your adventure, and eventually find a smith at the roundtable hold to take your weapons even further. sometimes, you may notice the glowing leaves of the erdtree fluttering down and filling the screen with their golden light. this will actually cause an invigorating effect to buff your character as well, and will increase the amount of runes you collect by a small percentage while the leaves are falling. players familiar to from software games may recall the ability to parry certain incoming attacks using a shield - when timed perfectly before a blow lands, you'll be able to knock a foe off balance and follow up with a critical strike. however, elden ring also introduces the guard counter. unlike the parry, the guard counter can be used regardless of your shield's skill, and has a longer window to fully block the incoming attack. if the attack is blocked, you can press the strong attack button to automatically respond with a powerful counterattack that deals more damage than a normal strike. it is best used against single targets, and when you know the incoming attack doesn't have any quick followups. however, since you're locked into the counterattack, you may leave yourself vulnerable when surrounded by multiple enemies, or those that can deal in rapid flurries. when done correctly, a guard counter can often stagger most types of enemies allowing you to follow up with a critical strike! the lands between are vast and sprawling, and you'll likely fight many more opponents between the rests you take at sites of grace, since they will cause all the enemies to respawn. to offset this, it is possible to replenish the charges of your healing and fp flasks without resting - by defeating entire groups of enemies. this includes certain points of interest like ruins and camps, as well as other places where groups of enemies have gathered. depending on the number or power of the group, you can replenish some or all of your flasks by doing so - but combat is a dangerous gamble if you are already low on flasks, so think carefully! aforementioned enemy camps are often sprawling and full of enemies - some that patrol, and others that lurk in the shadows. with bigger camps, you can often use stealth to lure out and pick off enemies one by one - but beware of enemies who carry a long horn. if you are spotted by them, they'll sound an alarm to bring all nearby enemies to search that position for you. though you can still kill the sentry and escape for enemies come to investigate if you are fast, you may need to move quickly if you don't want to be overwhelmed. while you can face most enemies in the lands between on your own two feet, you can also make use of your spectral steed, torrent, to engage in mounted combat. be sure to experiment with different tactics while fighting on your mount, as you'll find that there are certain advantages and disadvantages - whether fighting regular enemies and field bosses alike. you'll have much more mobility, especially when using torrent's longer sprints, and can alternate your attacks on either side. you can even use lance weapons to joust by stabbing at the right time, and their superior range can help give you the edge in combat. when you need to change things up, you can also dismount while running to perform a jumping attack as you land among your enemies. however, you can only use your right-hand weapon when mounted, and cannot block incoming attacks, so mobility and double jumping to dodge may be key to your survival. speaking of mounted combat, torrent isn't exactly invincible. your mount has its own hp pool that can be hard to keep track of, but it will take damage over time if struck. if a forceful blow is struck, you disappear until summoned again, but if too much damage is inflicted, torrent will die and be unable to be re-summoned on command until you rest at a site of grace. to remedy this, you should always be crafting rowa raisin to feed your mount. rowa fruit is incredibly abundant, and should be used often after a fight. otherwise, the only other way to bring torrent back is to sacrifice a charge from your healing flask to bring him back without resting at a site of grace. you're not the only one who can fight on horseback in elden ring. you may encounter other powerful enemies who ride horses who will try and run you down. some of them, like the tree sentinel field boss, is one with its mount, but other regular enemies can sometimes be found on horses that share different health pools. this means you can either focus on attacking the horse over the rider, or deal a powerful attack to dismount the enemy. an enemy who falls off their horse will be in a critical state for a moment, allowing you to get off a powerful critical hit before they can get to their feet. even if you don't plan to use magic in elden ring, fp is a valuable resource, as it's used for magical spells, weapon skills, and summoning spirits to aid you in combat. different spells and abilities have different fp costs, as do spirits - as weaker spirits may cost much less than a single powerful one. with spells and skills, they'll have a fixed cost - but many of them can be charged for greater effect. even when charged to their full potential, they still cost the same amount of fp, so always charge for maximum firepower and potential whenever you have the extra second to spare. many magic spells - whether sorceries or incantations - can be cast repeatedly by holding down the cast button, allowing you to fire salvos of attacks so long as you have the stamina and fp to keep the casts going. there are many weapon skills to collect in the lands between, called ashes of war . each one is different, and can be applied to many of your weapons and shields so that you can find the skill that works best for you. some ashes of war are very particular for which gear you can apply them to, while others can be used on almost any armament. in addition, ashes of war may also come with different weapon scaling effects to better suit your playstyle, or give your weapon magic damage or defense - though you can choose to just apply the weapon skill and not the scaling. experiment to see what works best with you, but know that certain legendary weapons may have fixed weapon skills that cannot be replaced, nor applied to other weapons. spirit ashes are a new feature in elden ring, allowing you summon creatures you encounter in the world as temporary allies. they'll mimic all of the moves they used in the wild, but to your benefit. as you find more spirit ashes, you'll find that some spirits appear in groups, while others appear solitary. this is usually related to their overall power and skill, and sometimes you may need to judge the best spirit for the job at hand. a group of wolves can quickly flank and a single target or small groups, but might not last long against a giant boss with sweeping attacks. you can also use spirits as a cheap way to get attention off yourself, as enemies usually hone in on the last target that attacked them - with careful timing, you can effectively ping-pong certain adversaries between you and your spirit. elden ring adds the ability for you to jump, but it's more than an exploration tool. while jumping, you can engage in melee attacks that can augment your abilities. certain weapons have unique attacks that can only be utilized in jumping attacks, and will deal damage similar to strong attacks. when used well, you can utilize jump attacks to stagger enemies on defensive, even while evading low sweeping attacks. jump attacks, along with strong attacks, can help break an enemy's poise and stagger them, allowing you to follow up with a critical strike. when an enemy becomes staggered, you'll be able to unleash a critical strike on them - but different types of enemies have different vulnerable spots: most humanoid enemies can be stabbed in the back or hit in the very front when they are staggered and fall to one knee. however, monsters like the giant land octopus, or the towering golem, and even the tiny land squirts will emit orange sparks when they become staggered, and if you strike at where the sparks are coming from, you'll be able to get off a critical strike there. generally speaking, you should try to leave no stone uncovered as you explore elden ring's vast open world. secrets are plentiful, and points of interest are hiding around every corner. your curiosity will almost always be rewarded with the promise of new items to loot, enemies to fight, or characters to meet - so you should feel encouraged to take your time and explore everything you see. if you're not sure where to travel to next, remember that sites of grace emit trails of light that drift off towards the direction of the next site of grace leading towards the next legacy dungeon. you can follow the trail of these sites of grace by looking for the light trails, or by checking the map to see the arrow insignia on each site of grace map marker to see the next direction to travel in. the guidance of grace doesn't just lead toward legacy dungeons - it can also lead to more challenging areas that aren't quite legacy dungeons but are larger than traditional mini dungeons, and hold valuable rewards. the lands between are full of narrow valleys, high cliffs, and rocky terrain that might try to funnel in your movement, but you can also look for gusting pillars of wind. you can use these while riding torrent to rapidly jump upwards and clear high cliffs in a single bound. these are often located in strategic locations to help you bypass choke points, or reach new areas faster. if you can't find a safe way down cliffsides and drops, remember that you can use torrent's double jump ability to slow your descent slightly, and more importantly, use your second jump to change direction to reach narrow ledges and rocks for a safer descent. elden ring includes the ability to jump for a reason - use it to explore places you normally couldn't in a dark souls game. many of the areas - especially the legacy dungeons, are designed with intricate verticality and exploration in mind, and offering multiple avenues to proceed. use your jumping ability to hop over ledges, drop down to low rooftops, and bypass dangerous areas - you'll never know what secrets you can find. you may soon find that certain points of interest have iconic shapes that will give you some clue as to what waits inside. ruined churches often hold sacred tears that can enhance your flasks, while minor erdtrees house powerful bosses that hold different tears for the flask of wondrous physick . there are also sorcerer towers that require a bit of thinking to enter, and may hold magic spells or memory slots inside. keep an eye out for glowing skulls, especially early on. you'll see a light golden shine coming from the eye sockets. they're home to golden runes, that, when used, give an instant 200 runes. simply destroy the skulls with your weapon or backstep on them to collect a quick bounty - or just ride over them with torrent and collect them as you gallop past. certain crafting material plants respawn rather quickly. hang out for a bit and you should be able to run back and collect more. you can also quickly rest at a site of grace to make most materials re-appear, so remember where you locate rare components! the good news is that while torrent can take damage, he's immune to the effects of poisonous swamps, meaning so long as you remain atop your spectral steed, you can traverse hazardous areas without any ill effects - but should you be forcefully dismounted, be ready for a world of hurt./n stuck and need a helping hand? ign's elden ring how-to guides are here to answer any early questions you may have when beginning

unlocking the fast travel system in game. while the developers have emphasized that they still fully intend on having players explore the world of the lands between and uncover the map for themselves, hidetaka miyazaki has revealed that fast travel will make an appearance in game. as you explore the lands between, you can uncover sites of grace that serve as bonfires to rest, recharge, and level up. by viewing them on the map, you can fast travel to any site of grace you have rested at, with a few exceptions. there are certain locations in the game such as dungeons that you will be unable to fast travel as a means of escape, and when in combat you will be unable to bring up the map, and must instead rely on items like the vision of grace to return to the last site you rested at. during these times, the icons for the sites of grace will have a red slash through them on the map to indicate your inability to fast travel. /n this page includes information on how to level up and increase your power in elden ring. when you begin your adventure in the lands between, you will soon be told that your character is "maidenless" and lacks the power to seek the elden ring for yourself. in order to grow in power, you will need to find a maiden of you own to level up with. simply finding and resting at the first site of grace you find won't be enough to level up, though you can at least recover your wounds. in truth, you'll need to rest at 3 different sites of grace out in the open world to trigger her appearance. note that this does not include the sites of grace in the stranded graveyard, or any in the mini dungeons that are found in the lands between. for a simple path to take to find three quickly, see below: by resting here, you will be visited by melina . she is a finger maiden, and can aid the tarnished in the search for the elden ring, by allowing you to trade in rune fragments for strength. once you have met with melina, she can use her power to level up your character in exchange for runes (what is normally referred to as souls in dark souls games). you will be able to choose one of several attributes to increase at a time, which can in turn raise various stats or allow you to equip certain weapons and magic when you reach the required level. unlike other fromsoft games, you can now use melina's power at any site of grace you rest at thereafter, and do not need to return to the site of grace you met the finger maiden at. remember that the runes you carry and collect by defeating enemies are dropped upon death, and you'll need to pick them up where you died after you respawn. if you die on the way back to getting them, they'll be gone forever. however, you can also collect fringefolk runes that can be consumed to obtained many runes at once, making them a great way to store runes until they are needed. /n this page contains information on how to obtain your spectral mount, torrent, and traverse large areas easily in elden ring. the lands between in elden ring are comprised of extremely large regions leading to the erdtree, and getting around these dangerous lands can take a long time on foot. luckily, there is a way to get a mount early in the game, if you know where to go to. as you begin to explore limgrave, you'll find a few sites of grace to save your progress at and recover your wounds. by looking at the early sites of grace in limgrave either in person or in the map, you may notice the tendrils of light pointing like an arrow off to the northeast. follow the path created by the sites of grace past the ruined church of elleh, through a forest path, and off to the gatefront ruins. just to the north of the ruins is a large imposing stormgate, and at its base is another site of grace. by resting here, you will be visited by melina. she is a finger maiden, and can aid the tarnished in the search for the elden ring, by allowing you to trade in rune fragments for strength. she will also give you the spectral steed whistle, which allows you to summon torrent as your steed. you'll need to use the spectral steed whistle each time you want to ride torrent, and it's best to assign the item to a d-pad pouch shortcut for easy access. torrent moves a lot faster than you do, and you can also sprint while mounted. however, unlike traveling on foot, pressing the sprint button will give torrent a short burst of speed, meaning you won't need to keep holding it down. like your own character, you won't use up stamina outside of combat when mounted, so you can continue to sprint with torrent indefinitely so long as you remain out of combat. torrent can jump twice, which means you can use the second jump in mid-air to not only gain additional height, but also move in different directions, or jump to a ledge when falling down from great heights. torrent can take damage, same as you, and big attacks can automatically dismount you and unsummon the steed. torrent can be healed both with magic and by crafting a rowa raisin to feed him. if torrent is killed, you'll either need to return to a site of grace to bring him back, or use up a charge from your flask of crimson tears. mounted combat can be incredibly useful in many scenarios, as you'll have increased mobility. you can attack to your right side by using rt/rb, and the left side by using lt/lb. you can also use magic while mounted too. fighting with spear-based weaponry can be very useful in mounted combat thanks to the range and increased damage. charging up these weapons allows you to ram into opponents and skewer them even as you ride past, even if the main attack doesn't land./n spirit ashes are a mechanic in elden ring that allows you to summon various creatures to aid you in battle. this wiki page will give you a brief overview of what these are, how they work, and the conditions you must meet to use them. similar to other from software games such as dark souls and bloodborne, elden ring allows you to summon other players and npc's for cooperation in both boss battles and overworld exploration. however, the new spirit ashes mechanic also allows you to call upon the spirits of the dead who, for whatever reason, were unable to make their way back into the roots of the erdtree. these allies range from packs of once-hostile enemies to legendary warriors to the spirit form of notable npc's. however, to be able to deploy these helpful allies from the ether, you need to collect both their ashes (found scattered throughout the world or via specific questlines) as well as the tool with which to use them (the spirit calling bell). if you're looking for more detailed information concerning spirit ashes, check out the following wiki pages: after receiving torrent from melina in west limgrave (more information on that here ), return to the site of grace at the chuch of elleh. upon resting there, you will see a new npc, who will identify herself as renna the witch, perched on a crumbling wall to the east of the site of grace. speak to renna and exhaust her dialogue to receive the spirit calling bell and the lone wolf ashes. after you have secured these items, renna will disappear. from here, you will now be able to summon your first spirits. spirit ashes can only be summoned in certain locations, and will disappear under two conditions to know whether or not you're in a location that allows for spirit summons, you will see a white gravestone icon in the bottom left corner of your hud. if you are fighting a field boss and move out of spirit summons range, the icon in the corner will begin to flash. the further you move out of these boundaries, the quicker it will flash; when it disappears, your spirit will also have dissipated. it's worth keeping an eye on this, as you will need to rest at a site of grace to re-summon if you move too out of range. to summon these spirits, you will need to select them from your inventory to activate. your character will automatically ring the spirit calling bell (no need to equip it) and your spirit will come to your aid. note that many require a certain amount of fp, with more powerful/legendary spirits requiring greater resources to cast. we recommend equipping your preferred spirit ashes in your quick bar for ease of access; many dungeon boss battles offer a limited amount of time to summon before combat engages, having quick access to call your allies for help is wise. knowing which spirit you want to summon for an upcoming battle can depend heavily on what you need most for the fight. sometimes they serve best as distractions for a boss, while other times you'll want a powerful spirit to support you with ranged fire or to simply tank enemy hits. we recommend trying out several different types to figure out which fit your playstyle best. if you're still not sure, we recommend checking out our page outlining the best spirit ashes . /n this page contains information on how to gain the proper resources to be able to craft your own items in elden ring, as well as where you need to go craft, and how you can collect more materials and recipes. upon starting your adventure in elden ring, your character will not able to craft items, but you won't have to wait long. after entering limgrave following the tutorial dungeon, take the path ahead to the church of elleh, and speak with the merchant to see that he has a crafting kit available for sale. you can buy it for a few souls, which you can obtain by killing nearby enemies in the forest to the east. with the crafting kit, you will gain a new menu option that you can pull up at any time, which allows you to pull up a menu and use materials you gather to create consumable items for both offense and defense. with the crafting kit, you'll have access to a few different items, but there are many more recipes to learn as you explore the lands between. these recipes come in various "cookbooks" located all over the world. some are hidden in chests guarded at enemy camps, and others can be bought from merchants you find while traveling. most cookbooks are themed, and some can teach you about infusing weapons with fire or gaining fire resistance, or learning new types of bombs to store in cracked pots. crafting more items will require more materials, and there are several ways to go about getting more. some items require plants and flowers to craft, and many can be found all over the lands between. some like mushrooms and moss are found in damp caves, while others like fulgurbloom only appear where lightning strikes. other items require parts from creatures you kill, which can be hunted all over the regions. you'll find slow moving animals to hunt both predator and prey, as well as slow moving birds perched on ruins, or solitary turtles by the water. some materials are more rare, and can only be found in secluded spots or guarded by fierce enemies. luckily, merchants will also sometimes sell these items, but at a limited quantity. /n elden ring's map is vast, sprawling, and obscured by a fog of war that you can reveal if you know how to unlock it. this page contains information on revealing the full map of elden ring . upon starting your adventure, you can open the map at any time (unless you are in combat) to see your position in the world, and travel to any site of grace you have visited provided you are not in a dungeon. however, besides the icons for points of interest and sites of grace, you will not be able to see any detail for the rest of the map beyond the borders of the land and major roads. in order to unlock sections of the map to see in more detail, you will need to locate map steles, large stone monument resembling a column with glowing writing on them that have a map fragment you can loot from them. they are often located in large enemy camps on the route to that region's legacy dungeon. once you have collected a map fragment from a map stelle, viewing the map will automatically update with your fragment to show you that region's topography in a stylistic design, including forests, cliffs, rivers, oceans, and other unique-looking art that can help lead you to find new points of interest, mini dungeons, or encampments. below you will find the locations of all map fragments that will help you expand your knowledge of the lands between. there are three different map fragments found at steles across the limgrave regions of west limgrave , east limgrave , and the weeping peninsula : the west limgrave map fragment is located at a stele found in the gatefront ruins, which you can find after exiting the tutorial dungeon by following the main road past the church of elleh through a small forest and into a large enemy camp at the foot of the stormgate. the east limgrave fragment is located in mistwood, near the minor erdtree. keep moving south of the main road from the third church of marika—the stele will be close to a giant bear scratching a tree. the weeping peninsula fragment is located just south of the castle morne rampart site of grace, where a golem will start firing giant arrows from afar. if you follow the direction from that site of grace, you'll be able to see as soon as you pass the stone wall next to it. to break out elden ring's liurnia map, there are three different map fragments found at steles across the liurnia regions of west liurnia , north liurnia , and east liurnia : you can find the east liurnia map fragment not far north from the liurnia lakeshore site of grace, surrounded by wraiths that will try and ambush you from the ruins and trees that flank the main road traveling through the flooded zone. you can find the north liurnia map fragment at the southern entrance to the academy gate town along the flooded main road leading into the town before you enter the ruins proper. you can find the west liurnia map fragment near the far northwestern tip - far north of the academy of raya lucaria and testu's rise, on a small road above the waterline just before the kingsrealm ruins, on the path towards caria manor. there are two different map fragments found at steles across the caelid regions of caelid and dragonbarrow : the caelid map fragment is located in plain sight along caelid's main highway that skirts the swamp of aeonia in a large half-circle, and the stele is found near the fork in the road where another path heads further southeast towards redmane castle, not far from a nomadic merchant. however the road leading to it is marked with danger, including a decaying dragon and one of the night's cavalry that patrols at night. the dragonbarrow map fragment is located along dragonbarrow's main road, just east of the dragonbarrow west site of grace. there will a couple of lesser dragons roaming on shallow waters. there are three different map fragments found at steles across the altus regions of altus plateau , mt gelmir , and the capital outskirts : the altus plateau map fragment is located along one of its main roads after breaking off north from the road leading to the southern capital entrance. the path is lightly patrolled by a few soldiers and undead, and you may also find brother corhyn nearby. the mt gelmir map fragment is located deep within the region, requiring you to undertake twisting pathways and climb up the mountain to reach the volcano manor itself, where you'll find the map stele on a road below the manor leading to the large broken bridge - but beware the hands that guard it. the capital outskirts map fragment is located right after the southern capital gate, past the two tree sentinels. the map stele can be seen next to the outer wall phantom tree site of grace on the main road leading to leyndell, royal capital. there are three different map fragments found at steles across the mountaintops of the giants, including the west mountains and east mountains sections, and the hidden consecrated snowfield . the west mountaintops map fragment can be located across the forbidden lands and just past taking the lift of rold up into the mountains proper - you'll find it as the narrow path curves right towards the zamor ruins, which can't be missed. the east mountaintops map fragment is located along the path up towards the summit of the mountains on the road towards the giant's forge. you can find it after crossing through the guardians' garrison and across the narrow chain bridge across a valley to the giants' gravepost site of grace. the consecrated snowfield map fragment can only be accessed once you have gotten both halves of the secret haligtree medallion and used it at the lift of rold to enter the snowfield. you'll have to head north along the low-visibility snowdrifts until the blizzard clears halfway up by a frozen river, and you'll find the map stele on the other side of the river by a giant tree, just a bit west of the main road where it has crumbled by the river. there are three different underground regions in elden ring that have multiple map fragments you can find, including the siofra river , ainsel river , lake of rot , deeproot depths , and moghwyn palace : the siofra river well map can be found soon after taking the lift down from east limgrave's well access, and you'll find it not far to the east of the siofra river bank site of grace, across the water at the steps to the hallowhorn grounds where 8 stone torches are set up along the stairs - the body that holds the map lies at the foot of them. the moghwyn palace map fragment can only be accessed either by following varre's questline or finding the secret sending gate teleporter in the consecrated snowfield, at which point you can continue exploring to find a body holding the map at the entrance to the dynasty mausoleum entrance site of grace. the ainsel river map fragment is located on a body you can find after taking the lift down from the east liurnia lift down to the well, and passing through the ant tunnels to a large room with a malformed star hanging from the top - below which you'll find an isolated merchant and the map nearby. the lake of rot map fragment is located deep past nokstella, eternal city on your second trip to the ainsel river, where you must take a lift down past the city into the poison lake entrance, where you can find a body holding the map by the poison lake. the deeproot depths map fragment can only be accessed by defeating the valiant gargoyles at the end of siofra aqueduct past nokron, eternal city in the far north, and taking a coffin ride to this new region. here you'll have to cross a series of roots to an area full of white waters and basilisks to find a body holding the map at a stone gazebo in front of various ruined buildings. /n this page contains instructions on how to get the flask of wondrous physick in elden ring. one of the first things you’ll realize when you arrive in the lands between is that the ability to heal is paramount. an easy way to get an extra healing ability (and the ability to customize it later) is to obtain the wondrous physick. the flask of wondrous physick can be found in the third church of marika in east limgrave, and you can obtain it as soon as you exit the stranded graveyard and emerge into the lands between. head north along the road to reach the church of elleh, then continue until you reach the gatefront ruins. follow the road away from the massive gate, then cross the bridge and take a left at the fork. follow the road until you reach the ruins of an ancient church. head inside and you’ll find the flask of wondrous physic and a crimson crystal tear, one of the ingredients you’ll need to create your own mixture. even without a second tear, however, it still functions as a heal, making your passage through the lands between a bit easier. bottoms up! you can find more crystal tears to mix into your flask to create new effects - like increasing stamina, boosting strength, and much more. you can even find more crystal tears not far from the church at the foot of the minor erdtree - but be warned, most other minor erdtrees are guarded by fierce erdtree avataars that must be defeated before you can claim different crystal tears. /n this page includes instructions on how to reach roundtable hold in elden ring. the roundtable hold is a hub for a wide range of activities (including a dedicated blacksmith, several ability vendors, and more) and it’s separated from the mainland of the lands between, meaning getting to it can be a bit tricky. fortunately, we’ve got you covered with instructions on two different ways to get there. if you wander outside limgrave (or get whisked away, accidentally), you can gain access to roundtable hold by resting at a site of grace in that area. melina will appear and tell you that she has been testing you and you’ve proven yourself. now that she is confident you have a chance at success, she will offer to ferry you to roundtable hold. take her up on it and you’ll be able to travel to it whenever you like from that point on. if you follow the guidance of grace, you’ll reach stormveil castle in northwestern limgrave before long. make your way through the soldiers guarding the entrance and you’ll come face to face with the first major boss in the game; margit. beat them, then rest at the next site of grace and your patron, melina, will appear, offering you passage to the roundtable hold. accept it and then you’ll be able to freely move between roundtable hold and the lands between whenever you like. /n this page includes instructions on how to participate in elden ring multiplayer, including helping other players in co-op, getting other players to help you, or even invade, antagonize, and fight other players. multiplayer is a big part of souls games, and elden ring is no different. in fact, it doubles down on multiplayer in a great way, making it something all players can reliably engage in without having to use rare items (like you would in demon’s souls or dark souls 3). at this time, it does not appear that elden ring has crossplay between different platforms, but more information will be added once the game (and multiplayer) is live. to jump into elden ring multiplayer, you'll need to do the following: to call for help: to help others to summon a player to fight: to invade other player games to get started with elden ring’s multiplayer, you’ll need a few items. thankfully, they are easy to obtain if you know where to look. the items you’ll need are as follows: furlcalling finger remedy (used

[ [1] ] once you’re there, smack the little talking red bush with your weapon and you’ll be able to speak to boc. do so until he says he’ll go search the cave for something valuable. [ [2] ] after that, you’ll be able to proceed and get the tailoring tools. head to the beach cliffs west of the first step site of grace. look around and you’ll find a small cave. head inside this coastal cave and you’ll find another site of grace. [ [3] ] [ [4] ] follow the cave all the way to the end to fight the demi-human chief double boss encounter. once you take them out, you’ll obtain the tailoring tools and the sewing needle. [ [5] ] now, when you rest at sites of grace, you’ll be able to spend some runes to alter the appearance of some of your equipment. [ [6] ] (additionally, if you return and give the sewing needle to boc at the coastal cave site of grace, he’ll appear at a liurna site of grace and waive your alteration fees). [ [7] ] /n in elden ring, you can equip two different armaments to your main (right) hand and off (left) hand, allowing you to strike with weapons , cast spells, fire bows, and block with shields. however, it's possible to two-hand a weapon in elden ring to increase your power, activate different weapon skills , and handle items like bows. by pressing left or right on the d-pad, you can cycle between equipped main-hand and off-hand weapons, but to wield a weapon in both hands requires a bit more work. to 2-hand a weapon or other armament, hold the y button on xbox, triangle on playstation, or e on pc, and then press the attack button for the armament you wish to use in two hands (rb/r1 or right click for main-hand weapons, lb/l1 or left click for offhand weapons). when done correctly, this will shift your chosen weapons into both hands, putting the other on your back until you use the same method to switch back to using two different armaments. when wielding a weapon in two hands, it will deal more damage and have its requirements slightly reduced, allowing you to make better use of a weapon you normally couldn't use effectively in one hand. this will also ensure the weapon skill you use will be from the chosen weapon you are 2-handing, rather than parrying or casting spells with your off-hand. note that when riding on torrent, you will automatically wield your right-hand armament in both hands, allowing you to strike on either side of your mount depending on if you press the left or right bumper/trigger. /n early on in elden ring you may find yourself tricked by a treasure chest trap in the dragon-burnt ruins that teleports you all the way out to a crystal mine. if you pull up the map, you won't be able to teleport out. if you step out of the wooden trap, you'll likely face enemies far stronger than you. if you're stuck in the crystal mine, officially called the sellia crystal tunnel, here's how to leave. a quick note if you’ve been stuck in the mine and have already explored: the most important thing to do is to find a site of grace. but more than that, you must sit at the site of grace to reactivate fast travel. if you only claim the site of grace, you won't be able to fast travel. after you've claimed the loot from the trap, wait for the miner to pass up the hill if he's just outside the exit of the wooden room. when he's passed, take a right while crouching (for extra safety). the miners who are mining won't care about you unless you take the ore they're mining. if you do anger them (or their overseers) and die, you'll respawn in the wooden room. walk down the hill past the miners. at the bottom, run left toward the passage that leads out of the cavern. you'll come across a wooden platform. jump or climb down the ladder and claim the site of grace. rest at the site, then leave the mine through the exit just ahead. once you're outside you can fast travel back to limgrave. if you're feeling a bit adventurous, you can explore this high-level area for a bit. one thing that may come in handy and doesn't take long to grab are the rotten stray ashes . approach the swamp of aeonia (careful not to draw the attention of enemies) and walk to the left around the swamp perimeter. not far from where you came should be a destroyed house with a rotted dog guarding it. kill the dog (it will build up poison if if bites you, so be quick to dodge it) and you can claim the rotten stray ashes and summon a rotten pooch of your own. check out the how to summon spirits page for a complete guide on how to get the spirit calling bell if you don’t have it already. /n this page includes instructions on how to improve pc performance for elden ring. if you are suffering from stuttering, frame drops, freezing, or low quality while playing elden ring on pc, we recommend the following quick fixes. many people are experiencing poor performance when playing elden ring on pc. while bandai namco has confirmed a patch is coming to improve framerates, reduce stuttering, and more, there are some in-game and windows settings you can change to make the experience better right now. credit: phish777 on reddit yongyea on twitter go to the windows search bar and search for graphics settings, then open it. towards the bottom, you’ll see a “browse” button. press it and search for “steam.exe” and click on it. then do the same for “eldenring.exe.” once they are both added, click options on each .exe and mark them both as “high performance.” on the desktop, press the windows key + x to bring up a menu. select device manager, then click into software devices. right click microsoft device association root enumerator and select disable, then confirm it. if you have nvidia control panel installed, open it and click on “manage 3d settings” on the left, then scroll down to “shader cache size” on the right. click on the drop-down and change it to unlimited, then hit apply in the lower right corner. (photo credit: phish777 on reddit ) open steam and right click on steam, then go to properties. under general, uncheck the box for “enable the steam overlay while in-game.” if you happen to be using the discord application to talk with friends or share your screen, having the overlay on can cause stuttering or even freezing - and you may not even know it's enabled. in discord, hit the settings icon, and scroll down to the activity settings at the bottom to select "game overlay" and toggle it off - you may even want to disable the overlay key binding as well. head into the game and go into system, then go to graphics, then advanced settings and set both depth of field and motion blur to “off.” /n exploring the roundtable hold for the first time, it's hard not to take fia, the deathbed companion, up on her offer for an embrace - but doing so will leave you with a red square icon with a down arrow - a debuff you may not even realize. this page contains information on how to remove the health debuff given by hugging fia. in truth, letting fia embrace you isn't all that bad, it won't kill you and the debuff - though annoying - isn't too terrible. you'll also be able to get new dialogue and story from her after doing it a few times, not to mention the blessing she gives. the baldachin's blessing is a consumble item that will temporarily raise your poise - a stat that allows you to weather incoming attacks without getting staggered or interrupted. this can be very useful against large opponents or even fast moving ones that constantly interrupt you with attacks. however, by accepting her request for an embrace, you may notice a small red square with a down arrow under your stamina bar. this indicates that you have an active debuff - one that doesn't even show up in status or menu at all. hugging fia actually removes 5% of your total hp, which can be a huge detriment in challenging encounters. this debuff will not leave even if you die, rest at site of grace, or use restorative items. getting rid of the -5% total health debuff is actually quite simple, though it can easily go overlooked. you need only use the baldachin's blessing that fia has given to increase your poise, and once the blessing's effects are gone, so to will the health debuff leave you. this means that if you want to take advantage of the increased poise blessing, you should only accept fia's request when you're ready to take on a challenging fight, and use it soon. otherwise, the longer the blessing sits in your inventory as you explore, the more you'll be missing that 5% of your health. you'll still be able to get more baldachin blessings from fia as much as you like - but only one can be in your inventory at a time. /n during your exploration in academy of raya lucaria you may come across, and be killed by, one of the two abductor virgins located within the dungeon. if this unfortunate fate befalls you, you will find yourself transported out of the academy and to mt. gelmir , somewhere in the depths of the volcano manor . unable to fast travel, you will have to escape the subterranean inquisition chamber by defeating the abductor virgins if you want to escape. there are two ways we know of escaping the inquisition chamber at this time, one intended and another, trickier sequence breaking strategy. check out our guide to escaping both ways: how to escape the abductor virgins how to skip the abductor virgins first things first you need to make your way to the nearest site of grace. hop over the pools of lava and make your way towards the small tunnel in the corner of the room you have been dropped in. here you will encounter some bats that you have to battle while avoid the river of lava. follow the lava to where it drops off, and look down to see some ledges below. carefully drop from ledge to ledge then continue to follow the lava while avoiding the fire slugs here. you will need to drop down another series of ledges until you reach a larger room with some torture devices in it. make your way up the nearby stairs and you will find the site of grace at the top. from here you need to drop down again, onto the pillar that is pushed up against the side of the structure you are standing on. traverse the fallen pillar and jump to the adjacent one top grab the smithing stone [4] resting on top. then jump your way to the far side of the room where there is another body holding a smithing stone [6]. next make your way towards the alcove on the left side of the room where you will find another tunnel. follow it to the end and step on the cracked floor to fall through. there is a lot of budding cave moss you can loot here. once you've grabbed it all head towards the opening on the opposite side of the room where you will find the boss room. if you got caught while exploring the academy this will likely be your most challenging (and frustrating) boss fight yet. battling two powerful enemies in such a small space can feel impossible, especially considering they both have wide ranges and an incredibly powerful grab attack. the best way to approach this fight, naturally, is to try and take them out one at a time to simplify the situation. you will want to focus on the (wheel) abductor first because it is the more mobile and in your face of the two. stand close to the wall and let it come to you. do not approach the (sickle) abductor at all. you want it to stay in the middle of the room as much as possible. try and position the camera so that you can see both abductors at the same time. keep your shield up and your eye on the (sickle) abductor. you need to make sure you are dodging the attacks from the (wheel) abductor while also avoiding the long range sickle throw from the other. you just need to have patience and wait for a moment where they both attack at the same time, then attack the (wheel) abductor while the (sickle) abductor is withdrawing its blade. this does not leave a lot of opening for attacks, but slow and steady wins the battle. pay close attention to the habits of both abductors because you will probably need a few attempts to get it just right. both abductors have an attack where they spin around in slow circles swinging their weapons around. the (sickle) abductor's version of this attack is much more dangerous due to its range, so simply run in the opposite direction if you see it winding up. both abductors also have their devastating grab attack. you will need to learn the timing of the grab, and dodge roll in right as the arms lunge at you. dodge rolling in may seem counterintuitive, but it gives you tyhe best opportunity to attack the exposed insides of the abductor for massive damage. once you have defeated the (wheel) abductor take a deep breath, heal up, and prepare to focus on the (sickle) one. at this point you will already be very familiar with its attacks, so don't rush. block all of its arm swing attacks and try to bait out the grab so you can hit the core. like i said before, if it begins to spin simply run as far away as you can. defeating the abductors will get you the inquisitor's girandole , and will open up an exit which lets you get outside and activate the nearby seethewater river site of grace. this will be a boon later, as this site of grace will help you more easily access the volcano manor when the time comes. but for now, congratulations! you are free to fast travel back to the academy and get payback against the abductor who did this to you. there is a slightly cheesier (and possibly unintended) way to escape the subterranean inquisition chamber , and to demonstrate i went ahead and made an all new character and rushed straight to the academy to get abducted. i didn't level up along the way, meaning i am attempting this as a level 6 bandit with 10 vigor. you can see my guinea pig character above, having just been dropped into the volcano manor. note that this strategy is a bit of a hassle, but well worth it if you cannot beat the abductor virgin boss battle. go straight ahead from this spawn point and peek over the ledge to your right. you should see a pool of lava below you, but you should also notice a few rocky spots where it is safe to stand (picture above). jump down and land in the lava below. you will take some fall damage as well as burn damage from the fire, so quickly drink a flask as you walk toward the rocky ground. beware the nearby slugs who spit fiery projectiles from their mouths. unfortunately that was only step one of your escape. go around the right side of the rocky pillar in front of you and you will find what looks like a town square that has become partially submerged in lava. look for a set of stairs nearby that lead to a platform above. make sure you are crouched here because you do not want to draw the attention of the serpent-man enemy at the top of the stairs. from your crouched position watch the serpent-man's movements, and as soon as he is turned away make a stealthy run for the cage elevator on the opposite side of the platform. this elevator will bring you to another crumbling platform, with another set of stairs nearby, and another powerful enemy. you will see an armored knight standing on the stairs to your left. unfortunately we cannot stealth past this one so you will have to draw him to the bottom of the stairs, then run away from him and then around him and up the stairs. do not enter the temple at the top of the stairs or you will trigger a boss fight against a foe far more fearsome than the abductor virgins. instead take a left at the top of the stairs and go to the bridge. activate the lever to raise the bridge from the lava, letting you get across. cross the bridge and walk past the closed door on your right (there is a site of grace right behind it, but sadly it doesn't open from this side). instead crouch again and go down the hill toward the city below you. sneak past the nearby serpent-man and drop onto these roofs. we need to reach the bridge on the other side but there is one more serpent man in the way. your best bet here is to run one roof length forward, then drop off the right side and onto the rooftop below. go forward from there and jump off the roof and down to ground level, where you should see a set of stairs leading up to a fog door. from here go left across the bridge, where we will see yet another serpent-man guarding a door. the door here is locked, so what you need to do instead is juke the serpent-man and jump over the railing to the left of the door where you can cross over a rooftop that connects you to the open side door into this building. once inside the dark room you need to go left, through the door and into the stairwell. the stairs down are guarded by speedy crawling enemies who will grab you and deal significant damage. at the bottom of the stairs enter the hallway on your left. you will see an enemy hanging from the ceiling at the end who will warn other enemies in the area of your presence. you can ignore him because our goal, the guest house site of grace, is right around the corner from him in a small room. run inside the room and touch the site of grace, then rest to rid yourself of the fast travel blocking debuff! it may take a few tries to get all the way through without dying, but the good news is the only punishment is getting sent back to the starting platform. with the debuff gone you are free to fast travel once again, and if you are feeling extra brave you can even run around this area of the volcano manor and grab some items or even attempt to defeat the powerful boss in the temple. check out our guide to volcano manor to learn more about the area! /n elden ring contains a very robust character creation system, allowing you to customize your looks to a very detailed degree. even after you've made your final choices, there are still a few ways to go back and edit your character's looks whenever you want. this page includes details on how to change your appearance in elden ring. once you have progressed far enough either into regions past limgrave or defeated margit the fell omen , resting a site of grace will prompt melina to invite you to visit the roundtable hold. there are many characters and features to take advantage of in this hub area - and one of them includes changing your appearance. from the main roundtable room, head right out the door into the hall where the blacksmith is and cross into the next room where fia the deathbed companion resides. look in the right corner of the room for a dressing table with a vanity mirror, and inspect it to select the cosmetics option. this will actually allow you to to completely edit your character's appearance - not just facial cosmetics, but body type, voice, physique, and everything else! the second legacy dungeon features the shardbearer boss rennala, queen of the full moon . defeating her won't actually kill her, and instead she will become an npc in the grand library that you can speak to. doing so will allow you two options - to fully respec your character's attributes in exchange for a specific type of currency, or to remake your character's image. like the vanity in the roundtable hold, you'll be able to totally alter your appearance, including every small detail that was present at the start of the game (minus the ability to change your class or starting gift). /n while elden ring allows you to choose a starting class archetype and level up by increasing the stats and attributes you feel are most important, you may decide later in your playthrough that you wish you had taken another path. luckily, it is possible to find a way to re-allocate all of your stat points to respec your character - but it won't be too easy. this page includes information on how to unlock the feature, and what is required to use it. in order to unlock the feature to reset all of your stat allocation and respec your character, you need to journey to the second main region in the lands between, the liurnia of the lakes area, and infiltrate the academy of raya lucaria . once inside, make your way to the top and defeat rennala, queen of the moon , the main boss of this legacy dungeon. after defeating her, she will become an npc you can talk to in the grand library, and present you with two different options: rebirth, and cosmetics. cosmetics will allow you to completely alter any part of your character's appearance - including body type and physique, while rebirth will give you a clean slate to re-allocate your attribute points and effectively respec your character. the ability to respec your character won't be free however, as you will need to hand over a larval tear each time you wish to respec your character. larval tears are exceedingly rare, and can either be bought from very hidden merchants, found on bodies in secret locations, or from defeating certain types of mimics. these mimics can be found hiding as ordinary enemies all over the lands between - but once defeated, they will shapeshift in a cloud of smoke into an entirely different (and often extremely tough) enemy, before you can claim the larval tear by defeating their second form. the quests involving ranni the witch also take you to nokron and nokstella, two areas that are full of them. there are also certain merchants that can sell them for a hefty price: the abandoned merchant in the siofra river well sells a larval tear for 3,000 runes (he's hiding up the scaffolding in the middle of the ruins in a cave above the giant miranda plant./n this page includes instructions on how to find a great early location to farm runes, which will enable you to buy whatever you need from merchants, level up a bunch, and generally have an easier time in elden ring. starting at the third church of marika (where you can find the flask of wondrous physick), head north to the shallow pond. on the eastern side, you’ll find a teleporter hidden in the brush. activate it to be transported to caelid. you’ll arrive in greyoll’s dragonbarrow, facing a large door. open it and activate the bestial sanctum’s site of grace. head back outside, avoid the giant winged creature on the stairs (it’s a world boss), and head into the fields. the small humanoid enemies here grant over 1000 runes for each kill (we got over 5,000 runes for killing one with golden eyes!), and they are relatively easy to kill, particularly if you sneak up on them and backstab them. there is also a ton of room to run around if you need breathing room to heal, escape, or ride torrent for mounted combat. if you stay close to the bestial sanctum, you can also even use your ashes to summon help while you farm (and there is a minor erdtree there with a golden seed, so you can even get an extra heal while you are here). you’ll be able to farm runes quickly here, letting you get a ton of levels early, or buy that thing you’ve always wanted from the merchants across the lands between. /n elden ring features a new mechanic in the souls genre that allows you to harness the power of the great runes held by the shardbearer demigods of the elden ring, and temporarily imbue you with new power - but the road to doing so can be incredibly confusing. this page explains how to obtain, imbue, and activate the great runes. as a tarnished, your quest will see you scour the lands between to enter sprawling legacy dungeons where the offspring of queen marika hold domain, the demigods of the lands between. each of these mighty foes have a great rune of the elden ring, and it will be your job to claim them. each of the major boss fights at the end of these legacy dungeons will conclude with you finding a great rune - but simply having it will not do you any good, as the power within will have dimmed and be devoid of any benediction. in order to get the great rune working again, you will have to seek out the divine towers of the lands between. there is one tower in each of the main regions - and they are hard to miss, often featuring a large crumbling bridge highway to a tower overlooking the seas below. each of the divine towers have different methods to gain access - some are much more puzzling to get to than others. for instance, the divine tower of limgrave can be found via a path on the east side of stormveil castle as you explore along the main castle path - though you'll have to fight or evade several powerful enemies. the divine tower of liurnia however, is only accessible through a puzzle in the carain study hall at its base, requiring you to undertake a series of side quests to find the proper item to advance. see how to activate godrick's great rune see how to activate rennala's great rune of the unborn see how to activate radahn's great rune once you've solved the riddle of how to get to the divine tower, you can take the lift to the very top where you'll find a spot to re-invigorate the great rune, and you'll be able to make use of its powers - for a price. simply restoring the power of a great rune won't actually do anything, although you can now equip one while resting at site of grace, and it will be displayed next to your health, stamina, and fp bars. in order to make use of the great rune's power, you'll have to find and use consumables known as rune arcs. these items are often held by bodies in out of the way or dangerous places - but can also rarely drop by killing rats all over the lands between. using a rune arc will set the great rune ablaze and allow you to benefit from its power. unlike other consumables, the this buff will not diminish over time. it will last for as long as you live - and dying will require you to use another rune arc to activate the power once more. just be wary, as you may want to save spending rune arcs for challenging encounters. looking for more to power up your great rune? see how to get more rune arcs/n this page contains information on how to activate and harness the power of godrick the grafted's great rune of power. this can be done at any time after you have defeated godrick the grafted in stormveil castle , the first legacy dungeon in limgrave. you may have stumbled upon the path to the tower while exploring stormveil castle, as the road to the tower can only be accessed while inside the legacy dungeon. you'll find the way along the main castle road past the main gate - which means you'll either have to sprint up through balista fire, or use the rooftops from the ramparts higher in the castle to drop down and take them from behind. be sure to activate the site of grace located above the main gatehouse for a quicker time getting to the large door on the right side of the path, guarded by a very powerful bladed lion. with the spot of grace activated we can now go back and face off against that fearsome lion. this enemy is both powerful and agile so it can be hard to find your spot to strike it or heal. your best bet is to throw up your shield and wait out one of its slow arm-blade attacks, then get in one or two attacks during the recovery state. do not try and punish the quicker bite or off-claw swipes as they are usually followed up with another attack. it is kind of cheesy, but if you fight the lion on the nearby staircase its attacks will occasionally go right over your head. defeat it to get a somber smithing stone [1], beast blood , and old fang x2. now you can progress through the large doorway it was guarding and reach the final spot of grace for this dungeon as well as the boltdrake talisman . proceed down the path and onto the long bridge that leads to the divine tower in the distance. unsurprisingly, this bridge is guarded by some more powerful enemies. there are three of these mechanical giants in total, and the good news is that they can hit each other, so try and position yourself between the melee giants and the ranged giant so that they may get struck by incoming arrows. otherwise, deal with them how you would a normal giant: bait out an attack, then strike their ankles while they are preoccupied. once all three giants are dead you can grab the loot on the bridge. there is a warming stone sitting on a smashed in section near the middle of the bridge, and then a soft cotton and ash-of-war scarab waiting on end of the bridge behind the teleporter. however, i would take the teleporter first and go into the divine tower and come back before dropping down to collect that loot because scaling up the debris is annoying. use the teleporter to be taken across the bridge to the divine tower in the distance. the door will not be unlocked until you have defeated godrick. with the rune in hand, open the door and take the elevator up to the top where you can activate a spot of grace get the true godrick's great rune. this can be equipped at a spot of grace to access its power using a rune arc. similar to the ember in dark souls iii, using a rune arc will give you the great rune buff until you die. /n this page contains information on how to activate and harness the power of rennala's great rune of the unborn. this can happen after you have defeated rennala, queen of the full moon in the academy of raya lucaria , the second legacy dungeon in liurnia of the lakes. in truth, rennala's great rune does not behave like other great runes dropped by demigods, possibly because she herself is not a demigod, but merely holding the rune of her former husband radagon. in fact, when you obtain the great rune, it will already be active - which means you do not need to go through the length process of uncovering the secrets behind the carian study hall to get to the divine tower of liurnia, as there is no activation process there. however, it does tie into both ranni's questline and rogier's questline , so you can view their quest guides to see how to access the tower. because it is different than other great runes, the great rune of the unborn cannot be equipped, and therefore does not need a rune arc to activate its power, it is instead a passive power that allows you to perform a certain action. essentially, the great rune is what is used to give you the power to "rebirth" your character and re-allocate your attribute points when talking to rennala after the boss battle. as the great rune itself mentions, it allows the power to perfect art of rebirthing, as ordinarily those rebirthed by rennala would be imperfect and short-lived. so long as you have the great rune of the unborn, you can speak with rennala and rebirth yourself in exchange for a larval tear - a rare item that is often found from defeating mimic tears - many of which around in the underground eternal cities, and a few that have disguised themselves as ordinary enemies around the lands between that will transform into a more powerful foe when killed. /n this page includes instructions on how to get the powerful meteorite staff very early in elden ring. the meteorite staff has 143 sorcery scaling and s scaling for intelligence, making it a fantastic catalyst for glintstone sorceries. the best part? you can get it incredibly early in the game, meaning you’ll make those early hours easier and set yourself up for success with your intelligence build. ride torrent over to caelid and ride to, or teleport to the astray from caelid highway north site of

building. kill the small plant enemies in the small side room and loot the body stuck in the window to obtain the powerful staff. /n this page includes instructions on how to get the powerful meteoric ore blade very early in elden ring. the meteoric ore blade is a strong weapon that deals split physical and magic damage, meaning you can deal damage to a lot of enemies that are resistant to one or the other. additionally, it deals bleed damage like the uchigatana, which is powerful against many different enemies in elden ring. the best part? you can get it incredibly early in the game, meaning you’ll make those early hours easier and set yourself up for success with your build. ride torrent over to caelid and ride to, or teleport to the astray from caelid highway north site of grace. from the site of grace, ride southwest, crossing the road and entering ruins filled with centipede priests. move through the ruins and down the slope near the cliffs to reach a ruined building with stairs leading down to a cellar. use a powerful summon and spells or abilities that can take out groups of weak enemies in cramped quarters and make sure to have a good shield with high stability, because the basement of this building is full of poison-spewing larva and one priest, all of whom emit clouds of poison. bring antidotes if you don’t have a lot of extra heals. after they are dead, open the door at the far side of the room and open the chest to obtain the meteoric ore blade. /n as you near the end of elden ring's story you will notice a large chunk of your map is still missing. you can see a road that appears to be leading out of leyndell, royal capital , and even a map stele, but no apparent way to access them. below you will find a guide explaining when and how you are able to access this secret region. how to get the haligtree secret medallion (right) how to get the haligtree secret medallion (left) the quest to reach the secret region of haligtree begins in the liurnia of the lakes region. journey to the albinauric village , located under the giant plateau south of the academy of raya lucaria . here you will find a ghost that is lamenting the end of the village, and pleading with someone named albus to hide. this is your hint that there may be something more to this small village. head up the hill behind the ghost and kill the perfumer enemy standing guard at the top. behind him you will notice an out of place looking jar. roll into it to reveal the hidden npc albus. albus will explain that he has been holding onto a special medallion in hopes he could pass it onto a special albinauric named lanna who is journeying to the chosen land. he will give you the haligtree secret medallion (right) and ask you to pass it on to latenna if you cross her path. with the first medallion half in hand return to the roundtable hold where a special event is awaiting you. you will spawn into a special version of the hold where esha of the royal remains will attack you. defeat him and you will be transferred back to the normal roundtable hold and rewarded with the special clinging bone weapon. immediately go to sir gideon's room where you will notice an item in the place where ensha was standing before. this is the royal remains armor set. go into the room and speak with sir gideon and ask him about ensha. he will apologize, then offer to help you on your quest for the other medallion half. he tells you that latenna is hiding a cave west of the laskyar ruins in the south of liurnia. teleport to the laskyar ruins site of grace, or any other nearby site of grace, and head straight for the spot marked on the map above, just below a rock formation near the bottom of the lake. you will find a cave opening that leads to the lakeside crystal cave . make your way through the cave, simply following along the path and dropping down to the ledges deeper in the cave anytime it appears you have hit a dead end. at the very bottom you will run into a bloodhound knight mini-boss. these enemies are fast, but they are incredibly susceptible to punishment via guard counter as long as you have a good shield. you will get the cerulean amber medallion upon defeating him. exit the cave through the runnel in the back of the boss room to reach the slumbering wolf's shack where latenna is resting with her wolf lobo (you can also find a site of grace and rune arc here). speak to latenna and show her your half of the medallion to gain her trust. speak to her again and agree to hear her request, and she will explain that she wants you to take her to the forbidden lands in the north, exactly where we are trying to get to. talk to her one last time and she will come along with you, in the form of ash item latenna the albinauric . at this point you will need access to the mountaintops of the giants to continue this sidequest, which becomes accessible after completing leyndell, royal capital and its boss. once you have completed leyndell and gained access to the mountaintops of the giants you can go to castle sol , located at the bottom of the cliffs in the northeast corner of this region. this is a tough dungeon. you will encounter two of the powerful lion enemies at the gates, many invisible soldiers, turrets, stormhawks, and teleporting knights. at the end you will have to battle the dungeon boss, commander niall, and his two summoned knights. you will want to defeat the knights first, starting with the quicker, dual-wielding knight. he is easy to separate from the pack then abuse with guard counters. a shield with the barricade shield ability does wonders here. commander niall seems to get a huge boost in power once his allies have been defeated, so at this point you can choose to defeat the second knight the same way or take commander niall on in a two versus one. i recommend just killing the knight and dealing with niall's extra power in exchange for a simpler fight. for such a big guy niall is surprisingly mobile, with a lot of dash and jump moves that can cross the battlefield in a flash. if you need time to heal or recharge your stamina make sure you are doing it when he is cooling down from an attack, not charging one up or you are likely to be caught off guard. any time he begins charging up, creating a flurry of snow around him, you just want to back off. all of these attacks are incredibly powerful, some of them hitting nearly the entire arena. it is better to just get back and afford yourself some extra reaction time, as well as an opening to punish the rest time afterwards. keep an eye out for his electric blade attacks as well, which are powerful but incredibly telegraphed making them easy to dodge and punish. he almost always follows up his strong attacks with a few weaker spear swings. these are your chance to block and fit in a guard counter, sometimes even multiple across one combo. defeating him will get you the veteran's prosthesis weapon. exit out the door in the back of the arena and follow the path up to the top where you will find another ghost you can listen to, as well as the haligtree secret medallion (left) . with both halves of the medallion in hand you can return to the bottom of the grand lift of rold where you will now have the option to "hoist secret medallion". executing this action will cause the lift to take you to the lands between's final secret region, miquella's haligtree . you can also go back and tell sir gideon you succeeded in finding the medallion and he will reward you with some information and the black flame's protection incantation. see the full walkthroughs for miquella's haligtree and elphael, brace of the haligtree here./n this page includes instructions on how to obtain unlimited smithing stones. [ [1] ] while areas like the limgrave tunnels have quite a few smithing stone 1s and some smithing stone 2s, once you loot the walls, you are left to rely on the low drop chance from killing miners. fortunately, there are ways you can buy an unlimited number of smithing stones of many different kinds, meaning you can more easily experiment with weapons you are interested in without running out of supplies. [ [2] ] in the area of liurnia of the lakes (in the lower, marshy area) you’ll find a site of grace called “academy gate town.” from there, ride north and follow the cliffs and you’ll find the raya lucaria crystal tunnel. [ [3] ] head down to the bottom level and defeat the boss (use strike weapons and block, then circle around and backstab to have the easiest time) to obtain the smithing-stone miner's bell bearing. [ [4] ] return to roundtable hold and talk to the maiden husks. select “give bell bearing” and then hand it over to add infinite smithing stone 1 and 2s to their inventory. [ [5] ] these let you upgrade common weapons to +3 and +6, respectively. [ [6] ] on the western edge of liurnia of the lakes, you’ll find the road to the manor site of grace. next to it is a friendly giant who can forge weapons and sells infinite somber smithing stone 1 and 2s. [ [7] ] these let you upgrade special weapons like reduvia to +3 and +6, respectively. [ [8] ] after you arrive at the altus plateau, you'll need to make your way through the heavily defended gates to reach leyndell, the capital city. once inside, you'll find a large outer area before reaching the legacy dungeon proper - and a large ravine separating the inner wall. search along the far south of the ravine below the walls to find the sealed tunnel, which is full of illusory walls to lead you further into the mini dungeon. the first main chamber has a chest on the right side guarded by vulgar militia, and inside the chest you'll find the smithing-stone miner's bell bearing 2. take this back to the twin maiden husks and you can buy unlimited quantities of smithing stone 3, and smithing stone 4. /n in the original dark souls trilogy, defeating a boss would earn you a boss soul. it’s no different in elden ring, except now they’re called remembrances. unlike dark souls, a boss remembrance only drops from some of the toughest main bosses you'll face - most of which are shardbearer demigods that are part of elden ring's "main story". once you’ve acquired them, it's up to you what you do with it - you can trade them in for a huge amount of runes, or purchase one of two different extremely powerful items. decisions like these can often lead to decision paralysis, but in elden ring, that’s a thing of the past because now you can duplicate these remembrances, and this page includes information on how to use the wandering mausoleums to get multiple remembrances from bosses. when you get a remembrance from downing a demigod or important story boss, just like a boss soul, you can just use it and give yourself a bunch of runes. for example, using the remembrance of the grafted which drops after defeating the first demigod, godrick the grafted , will earn you 20,000 runes. however, doing so could be seen as a quick grab for easy runes now, but you'll be missing out on potentially great gear later on. instead, you can travel to finger read enia in the roundtable hold after defeating your first demigod, and turn in the remembrance for one of two unique boss weapons or spells you can’t get anywhere else. for example, turning in remembrance of the grafted will give you access to either the axe of godrick, or a grafted dragon fist weapon. however, instead of having to pick one of these elden ring weapons , you can actually acquire both? well you can, and it’s actually quite simple. in each major region of the lands between, the tarnished can encounter a giant walking mausoleum. you’ve probably seen the first one in the weeping peninsula if you’ve made your way south; they basically look like giant turtles. you’ll need them to crouch down before you can enter them, and the way to accomplish this varies per region. for weeping peninsula , the nearby isolated shack vendor will sell you a note for 600 runes explaining how to do it for this region, but it’s honestly really simple. around the bottom of its legs, you’ll see chunks of white skull-like barnacles that you can break off – and that’s it. just go from leg to leg breaking off these pieces, and eventually the walking mausoleum will crouch down for you to enter. just make sure he doesn’t step on you, and once he starts to crouch, run out of the way so you don’t get squished. the wandering mausoleum in the weeping peninsula moves slowly and only needs its legs cleaned off the wandering mausoleum in north liurnia to the northeast of the academy of raya lucaira moves slowly but only has skulls lining its upper body, requiring you to wait for it to step close to the cliffs above near the bellum highway to jump onto it. besides the story-driven demigods you must defeat and earn their great runes and remembrances, there are also secret and powerful hidden bosses that can also drop remembrances. these enemies share a different pool of remembrance duplication, meaning there are specific wandering mausoleums that can only be used to duplicate remembrances from these secrets bosses, and not the ones from the shardbearer demigods: two wandering mausoleums in east liurnia around the uld ruins both have skull barnacles around their legs, but alternate jumping up into the air and crashing down with massive shockwaves. once a wandering mausoleum has stopped moving, head in the doors and simply select the remembrance you want to duplicate. the only thing to be cautious of is: you can only duplicate one remembrance per walking mausoleum. so choose wisely, and if you want another remembrance duplicated, you’ll need to find another walking mausoleum. it’s worth noting, you don’t actually need to have the item in your inventory when visiting the walking mausoleum. if you got the remembrance, and then used it to gain runes, that's ok, it just means you’ll only still get one from the walking mausoleum, meaning you can still only collect one boss weapon. so the choice is yours, you can either get a bunch of runes and one boss weapon, or save both remembrances and get both weapons. of course if you did burn a remembrance on runes accidentally, and you still want both weapons, you could travel to another walking mausoleum and duplicate it again. its our recommendation that you just dont use these for runes unless you’re absolutely sure you don't want either weapon. once you’ve done the duplication, you can now return to enia at the rountable hold to collect both of your unique items. /n this page will reveal how to obtain rune arcs in elden ring. once you defeat a shardbearer and claim their great rune, and restore their former power, you’ll be able to use rune arcs to activate their powers for as long as your current life lasts. getting rune arcs means being able to unleash some of your greatest strengths, but they can be tricky to find, if you don’t know where to look. you can buy rune arcs in limited numbers from merchants, including one in your hub area. in roundtable hold, the twin maiden husks sell 5 for 4,000 runes each. a good way to obtain rune arcs for free is to kill rats, who have a small chance of dropping them. the higher your arcane, the more of a chance you’ll have to obtain them (and anything else enemies drop), and you can also use a silver-pickled fowl foot to boost your item discovery while you farm. 640px some good locations to farm rats in the early game are: /n this page includes instructions on where to find a glintstone key. to gain access to the academy of raya lucaria , you’ll need a glintstone key. luckily, if you are quick on your feet, you can gain one easily in the southwestern area of liurnia of the lakes. head to the island just west of the academy of raya lucaria, which is located on the large central landmass in the marshlands of liurnia. as you approach, a glintstone dragon will awaken. you don’t need to kill it to get what you need. lure it away and ride torrent up to the place it was sleeping and you’ll see an academy sorcerer, complete with stone helmet. loot them to obtain the key and gain entrance to the academy. /n this page includes instructions on how to obtain the two halves of the dectus medallion and activate the grand lift of dectus in elden ring. in order to reach the atlus plateau, you can proceed through the ruin-strewn precipice or use the grand lift of dectus to skip it. in order to activate the lift, you’ll need the two halves of the dectus medallion. in southeast limgrave, south of mistwood, there is a place called fort haight. (you may have been asked to come here by kenneth haight , the lord of the fort) make your way to the top of the tallest tower and loot the chest to obtain the left half of the medallion. in the dragonbarrow , you can find the abandoned fort faroth, south of the minor erdtree. head inside to find all manor of bats and sirens. either fight your way through or simply sneak/run to the ladder at the end to reach a ladder. climb to the top to find a chest containing the right half of the dectus medallion. head to the northeastern corner of liurnia of the lakes to find the lift, then use the medallion to ride up to the atlus plateau and continue your adventure. /n this page includes instructions on how to obtain the gold scarab talisman in the abandoned cave. [ [1] ] the gold scarab talisman is a powerful accessory, as it increases all rune acquisition by 20%. this means you’ll be able to level up 20% faster, buy that elusive item 20% sooner, and more. because of this, this item pairs excellently with our guide on how to level up quickly and early rune farming locations. to obtain the gold scarab talisman, you’ll have to go to caelid, which is located east of limgrave, elden ring’s starting area. [ [2] ] from the smoldering wall site of grace in caelid, head east until you reach a small area with a mechanical foe on the cliff’s edge. [ [3] ] kill it or just run past it, and you’ll find tree roots reaching from one side of the ravine to the other. run across them to find the abandoned cave. the cave has a lot of rot pools in it, so be sure to take gear with high immunity, then kill the boss at the end to obtain the gold scarab, and let the runes flow! [ [4] ] /n there are many types of spirit ashes to summon for help in elden ring that you can collect, but only one can effectively clone you in battle. this page contains information on how to obtain the mimic tear spirit ash summon, and how you can maximize its effectiveness in battle. you won't be able to access the area the mimic tear is located in until you defeat starscourge radahn in caelid's redmane castle . doing so will cause a meteor to strike the ground in east limgrave, opening up a path to nokron, eternal city . enter this new area and move through the ruins until you face the mimic tear as a miniboss, though killing it won't enough to gain its ashes. instead, head across the bridge into the ancestral woods and hang along the left ridgeline until you find a site of grace for this area, and a series of building rooftops you can hop across to enter night's sacred ground. after fighting a few more mimics, you can cross an archway to enter a large cathedral looking place, with a lower section below you. don't hop down, but instead cross to the other side of the chapel to find a hallway leading to an imp sealed door. you'll need to use a stonesword key to open this barrier, and on the other side you'll find a nox swordstress guarding a chest that holds the prize - the mimic tear spirit ashes. unlike how you summon spirits of a different kind, the mimic tear doesn't require fp to summon - it requires a whopping 660 health instead! for certain builds, this may not even be feasible, but even if you have 661 health, it's well worth trading it for a charge of your healing flask - as long as you live long enough to drink it once you summon the mimic. the mimic essentially functions as an npc double of your character: it will use whatever you have on you at the moment of creation. this goes for equipped weapons, armor, a few charges of your flask, and even other tools in your pouch! the best part about this is that these won't take any consumables from your own pouch, meaning each time you summon the mimic it can apply weapon grease, toss pots, throw darts, and utilize pretty much anything in addition to weapon attacks, blocking, dodging, weapon skills. the mimic doesn't have your exact strength or your hp pool, as using glovewort to bolster it will increase its durability and damage output - but it will have your stats. this means that any weapon you can wield, the mimic can and will too - including making use of ashes of war. it also means it will benefit from weapons that you've bolstered with smithing stones - the higher the weapon level, the more damage your mimic will deal with it. however, what really sets the mimic apart is that because it copies your equipment at the moment of creation, you can then swap out items to effectively give your copy a different loadout. for instance, if you really like your holy greatspear, but wish you could be applying faster damage and bleed, you could equip a katana and summon your mimic, and then swap back to your spear while your copy keeps the faster weapon (or both use the same weapon to stack effects). if you have certain incantations or sorceries, you can equip them with catalysts to give them different roles. no matter what role you give them, you'll find they are incredible durable against most bosses, and you can swap out their gear to try out different tactics to compliment your own. it's only true downside is that it takes longer to summon than most as it first appears as a blob before morphing into your clone, and after summoning you'll have lost a lot of life, meaning fast-moving bosses can strike you down unless you can summon before entering their arena.
