ELDEN RING SAMURAI NOTES & TIPS
Unsheathe is an extremely powerful ability. Learning to use it often makes this Class much more powerful.
Thin out enemies with Arrows and then finish them with the Uchigatana.
A second copy of the Uchigatana can be found inside the Deathtouched Catacombs in Stormhill, Limgrave. This allows the Samurai class to dual wield two Uchigatanas almost immediately at early game, allowing one to rapidly inflict Bleed buildup at ease.
The best stat spread for pure Dexterity builds and tied with Vagabond for Strength/Dexterity hybrid builds. Also ideal for Dexterity/Arcane hybrid builds requiring 11 or more Strength, Bandit is better for 10 or less Strength.
Recommended for New Players and Veterans.
