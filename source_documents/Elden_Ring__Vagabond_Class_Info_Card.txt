ELDEN RING VAGABOND NOTES & TIPS
A tanky Class with good Stats and a 100% Physical Damage reduction Shield allowing players a sizeable advantage over some other Classes. Great for new players and veterans that don't plan to use Spells.
This class' stats are optimal for:
Strength/Dexterity quality builds, ties with Hero if you wish to minimize mind investment and ties with Samurai if you desire to invest in mind.
Any and all Strength/Faith hybrid builds. 
Has the lowest Arcane stat of all the classes.
The Vagabond is the only starting class that starts off with a fat roll (70% weight). It's advised that players un-equip the some equipment like the Halberd or some armor pieces so they can obtain a medium roll at the start, or level up their Endurance for more equip load.
