ELDEN RING WRETCH NOTES & TIPS
Due to it's lack of starting equipment, this Class is best recommended for experienced Souls players, or for players that are looking for more challenge
Although the Wretch is the least optimized for any one build, the lowest starting level and evenly distributed stats make them ideal for players new to PvP wanting to dabble in different builds since they can respec into any other build and be fairly efficient at it. Significantly easier than going through the game with an entirely different starting class just to try a new build.
Since start of the game does not have any non-optional boss, starting with this class is easier than in previous games.
You can get your first armor set by farming Godrick soldiers near Groveside cave entrance.
