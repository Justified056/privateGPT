ELDEN RING PRISONER NOTES & TIPS
This class' stats are optimized for:
Strength/Intelligence hybrid builds where Dexterity does not need raising any higher. If more Dexterity is required, it becomes tied Samurai.
Dexterity/Intelligence hybrid builds where required Strength is between 10 and 12. Any lower, Astrologer becomes optimal. Any higher, it ties with Samurai
The design seems influenced by Griffith/Femto from the Berserk manga and anime series.
The best pick for Dexterity/Intelligence hybrid builds demanding 11 or more Strength. Astrologer outperforms at 10 strength or less.
Though a more advanced playstyle, it's hard to argue that this Class has an exceptional loadout and stat spread. Not recommended for new players, but will shine in the hands of a Souls veteran.
A good start for Dex + Int builds.
