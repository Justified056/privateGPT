ELDEN RING HERO NOTES AND TIPS
This class replaces the "Champion" of the Closed Network Test.
This class' stats are optimized for:
Pure Strength builds that do not increase their Dexterity higher than 12, after which Vagabond becomes more optimal.
Pure Strength weapons include Brick Hammer, Gargoyle's Great Axe, Giant-Crusher and Nightrider Glaive.
Pure Arcane builds that do not invest any points in other damage stats. If more Dexterity is required, Bandit may be more optimal.
Infusable weapons with innate status effects that only require 9 or less Dexterity requirement include Spiked Club, Morning Star, Star Fist and Venomous Fang. All of which can be infused with Occult, which affects status effect buildup based on Arcane stat. The Spiked Club in particular has A scaling for Arcane under Occult infusion.
Strength/Arcane builds that utilize heavy weapons to deal high damage or to inflict status effect via Occult infusion or innate Arcane scaling. At 34 Strength and 60 Arcane, some weapons' attack rating can rival that of Pure Strength builds when applied with Occult infusion.
Strength Arcane weapons with innate status effects include Mohgwyn's Sacred Spear, Great Omenkiller Cleaver, Great Stars, Flamberge, Spiked Club, Grave Scythe, Rotten Battle Hammer and Rotten Greataxe.
Strength Arcane weapons with high attack rating include Marais Executioner's Sword, Warped Axe, Greatsword and Brick Hammer.
Strength/Dexterity quality builds that do not intend to increase mind. If you do require more mind, Vagabond becomes more optimal.
