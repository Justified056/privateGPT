ELDEN RING BANDIT NOTES & TIPS
This class' stats are optimized for:
Dexterity/Arcane hybrid builds that need less than 12 Strength, after which Samurai becomes more optimal.
Dedicated pure Arcane Reduvia build, since this class already meets all requirements to use the weapon.
Comes equipped with a Buckler shield. Due to its unique skill, Buckler Parry, players who pick Bandit will immediately have one of the best parry tools once they start playing.
Recommended only for veteran players, as the Bandit starts off squishy and their equipment is not well-suited for head-on, aggressive combat.
