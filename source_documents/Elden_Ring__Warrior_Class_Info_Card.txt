ELDEN RING WARRIOR NOTES & TIPS
Despite the class' stats suggesting a dexterity build, it is outclassed by the Samurai in terms of build optimization, unless you intend to use either glintstone pebble or bestial constitution which the Warrior can access without further investment.
The Warrior starts with two Scimitars. When holding both in either hand, press L1 to attack with both. These L1 attacks deal more damage than R1 and applies status effects (Poison, Bleed, Cold) at a faster rate.
