ELDEN RING PROPHET NOTES & TIPS
This Class is best suited for players that want to focus on Incantations. While Catch Flame is a good spell, you might run out of mana during the early parts of the game.
Best for pure Faith builds and Dexterity/Faith and Faith/Arcane hybrid builds. Also ideal for Strength/Faith hybrid builds at 11 or less dexterity but outperformed by Vagabond at 12 or more.
