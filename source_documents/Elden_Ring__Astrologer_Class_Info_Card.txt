ELDEN RING ASTROLOGER NOTES AND TIPS
A very good mage setup that's easy to upgrade quickly due to access to spells and a good Staff early on. Excellent for new players and veterans alike.
This class' stats are optimized for:
Pure intelligence builds that do not plan to use melee weapons.
Hybrid builds that include either of the other two casting stats - or both.
Dexterity/Intelligence hybrid builds that require less than 10 Strength, after which Prisoner becomes optimal.
Dedicated Intelligence/Faith build that primarily utilizes Sword of Night and Flame. Compared to the Confessor, Astrologer requires 4 more Strength in order to meet the Strength requirement of the weapon.
This class replaces the Network Test's "Enchanted Knight" as a starter mage choice
Has the lowest amount of Vigor out of the other 9 classes. Players who pick Astrologer must know when to pick their battles and use their ranged spells to their advantage.
