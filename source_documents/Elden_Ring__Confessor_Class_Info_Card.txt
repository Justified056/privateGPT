ELDEN RING CONFESSOR NOTES & TIPS
Although designed to be a mix of combat and stealth, this Class can be seen as the defacto "Paladin" class. This one sets players up with a 100% Physical Damage reduction Shield, as well as good Faith for Incantations.
While the stats of this class indicate it is the best choice for a hybrid build between Faith and Strength/Dexterity, there is actually no build where Confessor is the most optimal choice, and in many instances is actually worse than Wretch due to the thin distribution of points across Strength, Dexterity, Faith and Arcane causing too many wasted points. Vagabond is often the better pick for a Strength/Faith build, while Prophet is better for Dexterity/Faith.
It can also be used for an Intelligence/Faith build that primarily utilizes Sword of Night and Flame, since the class has already met the Strength and Dexterity requirements of the weapon.
